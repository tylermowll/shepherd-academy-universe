                  These addresses are reached from the app server, not from your
                  phone. A host model used from Docker must listen on an
                  interface Docker can reach; keep it behind the computer
                  firewall and do not expose it to the public Internet. If the
                  model runs elsewhere, use its reachable private address. A
                  text-only model cannot read photos; enable photo support only
                  for an image-capable model and test it.

                  after checking the current age and data terms for your
