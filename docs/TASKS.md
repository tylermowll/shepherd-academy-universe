# Implementation tasks

The normative scope, dependencies, deliverables, and exit evidence are in
[specification section 15](SPECIFICATION.md#15-implementation-roadmap). This file
records implementation status; a task is complete only when all of its
specification gates pass.

| Task | Status                                                         | Current evidence / next boundary                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### T41 — Journey reliability and flow review (2026-09-19)

A role-by-role review covered first setup, administrator Settings and Learners,
learner Practice and History, Help, phone capture, native startup, and Docker
startup. The overall role split and Settings sequence were sound, but several
transition failures could make saved work look lost or lead to a duplicate
session. The tutor conversation also left only a small nested viewport at common
laptop and phone sizes. Operator instructions mixed native and Docker launch
paths and gave containers a host-model address they could not reach.

Changes and affected contracts:

- A successful session POST now commits the returned session, URL, and history
  before its follow-up refresh. A failed refresh keeps the acknowledged session
  open instead of returning to an enabled Start form. Session selection changes
  commit only after a successful load, so a failed History navigation cannot
  redirect later polling to the wrong session, and an explicit History choice
  finishes before background polling can supersede it. Reference text blocks
  navigation only while that source is selected; switching sources preserves but
  no longer hides a blocking draft.
- A successful connection save followed by a failed list refresh now leaves a
  persistent, named refresh action after the editor closes. Ordinary save
  failures remain beside the open form and preserve its entries. Active-model
  completion links directly to Learners.
- The header identifies the signed-in username and role. Help-topic navigation
  focuses the selected article, setup guidance continues through learner
  creation, and privacy wording now matches the actual learner History plus
  administrator JSON export/delete controls.
- The conversation follows the start of the newest exchange instead of hiding
  its learner message above the scrollport. Stable desktop/mobile heights expose
  more than 240 pixels of conversation in the browser regression. Compact
  composer menus remain inside narrow viewports, and a completed phone reading
  or any remote operation update dismisses the attachment panel when no saved
  upload retry is pending. Opening Help or Next also hides that panel without
  discarding a prepared photo, so it cannot cover the next learning action.
- Compose maps `host.docker.internal:host-gateway` for both API probes and worker
  inference. Phone/provider guidance distinguishes native loopback addresses
  from Docker host addresses, separates Docker and native launch/reset paths,
  orders phone setup so the app is running before its Settings steps, and
  describes administrator sign-out, separate learner sign-in, and atomic Start
  session behavior. Current user and operator guidance no longer presents
  retired pairing or old Settings labels as active workflows. Hosted CI now
  parses the Compose deployment before building its container.
- The lockfile advances `@redocly/openapi-core` to 1.34.20 and `js-yaml` to 4.3.2,
  closing GHSA-2883-xcg3-v3hh. The Playwright login helper also waits for the
  asynchronous logout redirect, removing a reproduced navigation race without
  adding retries or weakening an assertion.

Validation:

- `pytest apps/api/tests/unit`: **194 passed**. `pytest
  apps/api/tests/integration`: **267 passed** with the existing Starlette
  deprecation warning.
- `pnpm test`: **162 passed** across 10 frontend files. The Tutor
  recovery regressions, provider refresh recovery, account identity, and setup
  handoff/topic-focus tests passed. Ruff, ESLint, Prettier, strict mypy (**70 source files**),
  both TypeScript checks, generated-contract drift, secret scanning, IaC lint,
  the synthetic evaluation, and the production web/PWA build passed. The
  existing Vite chunk-size warning remains.
- `pnpm smoke`: **66 passed** across desktop and mobile Chromium with pinned
  Node 24.20.0 and pnpm 12.3.4. The browser suite asserts that the newest exchange
  starts inside the conversation viewport, its usable height exceeds 240 pixels,
  both composer menus stay inside the chat at 320, 375 and 412 pixels, the chosen
  Help topic receives focus, and the page has no horizontal overflow. Synthetic
  screenshots were inspected at desktop and phone widths.
- Frozen pnpm and uv lock checks passed. Both Python and pnpm audits reported no
  known vulnerabilities. A locked PyYAML parse asserted the host-gateway mapping
  on both Compose services, and `git diff --check` passed.

Docker is not installed in this workspace, so the added `docker compose config`
step, container smoke, image scanning, and SBOM generation remain hosted-CI gates
for this commit after the push.
No live/paid provider inference, model download, deployment, private setting,
real learner data, or private log was used. Actual phone/accessibility checks,
live model quality, and the private-host release rehearsal remain the existing
maintainer acceptance work. A readable administrator session-history view is a
separate product decision; T41 makes Help accurately describe the current JSON
export/delete boundary rather than silently expanding D013.

### T40 — Load Settings after account creation (2026-09-08)

After account creation, the session refresh invalidated pending Settings requests
even when it returned the same session. `client.ts` now leaves requests alone when
the CSRF token and authenticated state are unchanged. Responses that cross an
identity change are still rejected, including during body decoding.

Affected contracts: browser session isolation and the signup transition to
Settings. No API schema, cookie, database or provider behavior changed. Client and
component tests cover the response ordering; native browser tests now require
loaded Settings controls after signup. SPECIFICATION records the requirement and
HANDOFF describes the current installation.

Validation:

- The two client refresh cases and the component signup case failed before the
  fix. The component showed the reported Session changed error and Retry AI
  settings button. After the fix, `pnpm --filter @math-tutor/web test
  tests/client.test.tsx tests/Setup.test.tsx`: **42 passed**.
- `make check`: **194 backend unit tests**, **152 frontend component tests**,
  lint, formatting, types, builds, contract drift, secrets and IaC checks passed.
  The first sandboxed attempt could not create loopback sockets; rerunning with
  socket access passed. The existing Vite chunk-size warning remains.
- `docker build -f infra/docker/Dockerfile -t math-practice-tutor:local .` and
  `sh scripts/container-smoke.sh math-practice-tutor:local`: passed. The smoke
  uses disposable containers and synthetic data.
- `pnpm exec playwright test tests/smoke/setup.spec.ts tests/smoke/bootstrap.spec.ts
  --grep 'waiting update|native browser setup|installed update|browser setup permission|another learner|isolated and revocable'`:
  **14 passed** across desktop/mobile Chromium. Signup, lost responses, reloads,
  updates, account switching and revocation passed.
- Authorized `docker compose -f infra/docker/compose.yaml up -d --no-build api
  worker`: passed. Compose loaded private settings normally. Both services run
  the tested image; HTTPS readiness and the served frontend asset names match
  the tested build. The public setup check confirms the administrator remains.
- `make hooks-check secret-check` and `git diff --check`: passed.

Backend integration and the full browser suite were not repeated for this
frontend-only change; T39 recorded 267 integration and 66 browser passes. No live
provider calls, account resets or data migrations were performed. The agent did
not open private settings or inspect the user's authenticated Settings response.

### T39 — Finish setup without repeating startup (2026-09-08)

The API was healthy, but its thirty-minute owner link expired before account
creation. The form discarded its permission and returned to terminal instructions.
T38's update guard did not address this expiry.

Exchange the owner link on opening for a signed HttpOnly setup cookie, valid for
eight hours and restricted to the setup API. The cookie survives API restarts
with the same deployment secret. Discard the owner token after exchange. Account
creation still requires CSRF, the configured origin, valid setup permission and
an atomic check that no administrator exists. Refresh anonymous CSRF before
submission so an idle form remains usable. D014 records this change to D011.

Affected contracts: setup requests/status, cookie scope and expiry, one-use link
exchange, frontend recovery and generated API clients. Tests must cover link
expiry after exchange, reload/restart, invalid cookies, missing authority,
concurrent claims, validation, lost responses and cancellation. Required gates:
targeted tests, `make check`, integration, affected browser tests and a disposable
container check before the authorized local update. No migration or compatibility
path.

Changes: `api/setup.py` exchanges links and authorizes account creation through
the scoped cookie; `setup_gate.py` signs and verifies its purpose, origin and
expiry. `Setup.tsx` exchanges once, recovers browser permission and refreshes
anonymous CSRF before submitting. Generated OpenAPI and TypeScript clients were
regenerated with `make contracts`. Setup/help copy and the operating documents
describe the new flow. The direct token-in-account-request path was removed.

Validation:

- Targeted setup/owner integration tests: **43 passed**. Setup component tests:
  **25 passed**.
- `make check`: passed, including **194 unit tests**, **147 component tests**,
  lint, format, types, builds, contract drift, credential scan and infrastructure
  lint. Initial typing/format errors and a test fixture that incorrectly returned
  visitor state after signup were corrected before the final passing run.
- `make test-integration`: **267 passed** against temporary SQLite databases.
- `pnpm exec playwright test tests/smoke/setup.spec.ts tests/smoke/bootstrap.spec.ts
  --grep 'waiting update|native browser setup|installed update|browser setup permission'`:
  **10 desktop/mobile cases passed** using the installed Chrome browser. The
  restart test exchanges the link, reloads, restarts the API, removes anonymous
  CSRF, and successfully creates the account without reopening the owner link.
- The earlier `dc70a7e` GitHub run failed 21 browser cases with navigation aborts.
  `createLearner` began the next login before logout's redirect completed.
  `tests/smoke/support.ts` now waits for the sign-in form before navigating again.
  The assertions and application rate limits are unchanged.
- Final `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome make smoke`:
  **66 desktop/mobile cases passed** in 9.5 minutes, including the cases that
  failed in the earlier CI run.
- `docker build -f infra/docker/Dockerfile -t math-practice-tutor:local .` and
  `sh scripts/container-smoke.sh math-practice-tutor:local`: passed. Container
  tests use a disposable database and cover exchange, renewal, stale links and
  account creation.
- The local API and worker were updated through the authorized Compose settings
  load and passed HTTPS readiness. The public setup check then reported that an
  administrator already exists. The owner command returned only the app address,
  which was opened on the desktop. Live first-account verification was therefore
  skipped; the existing account was preserved. The agent entered no credentials
  and created no account.

No migration, data deletion, model download or live provider call. The existing
Vite chunk-size and Starlette deprecation warnings remain. The unrelated image
is excluded from the change.

Final `make hooks-check secret-check` passed with the corrected browser helper.
`git diff --cached --check` passed, and local link targets exist in all nine
changed Markdown files.

### T38 — Docker setup recovery and signup update handling (2026-09-08)

`make start` tried to launch a native app while Docker already held port 8000.
The browser then asked for a setup link that the running container could not
renew. Clicking the app update during signup also discarded the tab's setup
permission.

The current implementation:

- `container_start.py` and `local_start.py` connect to the recognized Docker API
  before loading native settings, checking Node or touching another database.
  Explicit native modes and alternate environment files retain their behavior.
- `owner_setup.py`, `setup_gate.py` and the API lifespan provide a private Unix
  socket for issuing links. Renewal checks the database under a write lock and
  stores only the new token hash and expiry in memory. Previous links are
  rejected. Existing accounts receive the sign-in address.
- `App.tsx` and `UpdateNotice.tsx` defer update refresh during signup. The normal
  update action returns after account creation establishes a session. Setup
  tokens stay in tab memory.
- `Setup.tsx` and `Help.tsx` explain link renewal and separate administrator and
  learner accounts. README, RUNBOOK, PHONE_SETUP, SPECIFICATION, DECISIONS,
  THREAT_MODEL, ACCEPTANCE and HANDOFF describe the current behavior.
- Compose uses the fixed project name `shepherd-academy-universe`. The deployed
  API and worker use the retained database in the current checkout. The obsolete
  containers and their unused network were removed. No migration, account reset
  or data deletion was needed.

Validation completed before the documentation review:

- `make check`: passed, including **194 backend unit** and **145 frontend
  component tests**, lint, formatting, types, builds, contract drift, credential
  scan and infrastructure lint.
- `make test-integration`: **254 passed**. An earlier run collided with a browser
  asset rebuild; running the gates sequentially resolved that failure.
- `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome make smoke`:
  **62 desktop/mobile cases passed** before the signup update fix. After that
  fix, `pnpm exec playwright test tests/smoke/setup.spec.ts
  tests/smoke/bootstrap.spec.ts --grep 'waiting update|native browser setup|installed update'`
  passed all **eight affected cases**, and `make check` passed again.
- `docker build -f infra/docker/Dockerfile -t math-practice-tutor:local .` and
  `sh scripts/container-smoke.sh math-practice-tutor:local`: passed. The container
  test covers readiness, link renewal, stale-link rejection, account creation
  and refusal to issue another link after account creation.
- The updated local containers passed HTTPS readiness. An isolated browser
  verified the editable administrator form and a deferred waiting update. A
  fresh setup link was opened in the maintainer's desktop browser. The agent
  entered no live credentials and created no live account.

The maintainer authorized Docker to load private settings for the cutover.
Settings contents, tokens and private diagnostics were kept out of tool output
and Git. No live provider tests, model downloads or public deployment were run.
Physical phone and model-quality checks remain deferred. The existing Vite
chunk-size and Starlette deprecation warnings remain.

Publication review: startup and recovery instructions now distinguish native
and Docker commands. The handoff describes T38; completed cutover instructions
and superseded handoff summaries were removed. `make hooks-check secret-check`
passed on the staged changes, and `git diff --cached --check` found no whitespace
errors. Local link targets exist in all nine changed Markdown files. The
maintainer authorized pushing the reviewed changes to `main`. The unrelated
untracked image is excluded.

### T37 — Account and practice usability review (2026-09-08)

Implemented under the maintainer's fourteen-point review and subsequent
account, menu, branding and clean-reset instructions. D013 records the account model: one administrator, unique
learner usernames, administrator-managed passwords, a shared sign-in page,
and account controls placed beside the selected learner. Existing learner IDs
and work must survive the migration; duplicate profiles must not be merged.

Affected contracts: learner creation/public serialization, password reset,
authentication/session revocation, learner device listing and ownership,
retired pairing endpoints, migration/schema integrity and typed API clients.
Required tests: duplicate-name and admin-name collisions; valid/invalid learner
login, reset and stale-login races; two-learner/adult isolation; no password/hash
disclosure; existing-data migration and rollback; learner account management
and sign-in in desktop/mobile browsers. Required gates: `make check`,
`make test-integration`, `make smoke`, `make eval-mock`, container smoke and
readiness after a controlled migration/rebuild. No live provider calls.

The same review also covers practice startup, tutor/connection choices and
wording (3–5, 10–14), phone-camera lifetime and recovery (7), mutually exclusive
composer menus, administrator-only management pages and the corrected Shepherd
name. Added contracts/tests: atomic initial activity with idempotent retry;
unchanged connection saves preserve tested approval; actual changes still block
unapproved use; two-hour camera expiry and regeneration; keyboard/pointer menus.
The maintainer additionally authorized resetting the local installation, including
accounts and saved Spark setup, for a clean cutover. The earlier rebuild/push
authorization applies. No live inference is authorized.

Implemented review changes:

- `api/learners.py`, `auth.py`, `account_names.py` and migration 0017 replace
  passwordless pairing with unique learner usernames and administrator-managed
  passwords. Resets revoke prior sessions; public schemas never return hashes or
  passwords. Existing histories migrate without merging learners.
- `LearnerAccounts.tsx` places sign-in, browser and saved-work controls beside
  the selected account. `App.tsx` limits administrators to Learners/Settings/Help
  and learners to Practice/History/Help. The browser experiment is removed from
  the application entry and settings UI; its isolated research source remains.
- `api/tutoring.py` and `Tutor.tsx` start a session and its first activity in one
  transaction. Topic/reference input, difficulty and explained tutor styles are
  collected together. `ComposerMenu.tsx` closes menus on another menu, selection,
  Escape or an outside click.
- `api/provider_connections.py` preserves tested approval for unchanged saves.
  Real configuration/credential changes still require tests and activation.
  Settings uses named sections, explicit cloud/data wording, Add new AI connection,
  Cancel changes and an editor Delete control. Active connections must be replaced
  before deletion. Saving Data & privacy is the explicit consent action; merely
  changing a control sends no request.
- Phone links accept one photo for the current activity, last two hours and offer
  **New QR code**. Full phone practice uses the learner's credentials. Existing
  ownership, expiry, replay, revocation and processing-policy checks remain.
- Public branding and the Git remote use **Shepherd Academy Universe** and the
  corrected repository name. The app uses a small book-and-star SVG. The supplied
  banner remains untracked and unchanged.

Validation:

- `make check`: passed; **181 unit and 145 component tests**, lint, formatting,
  types, builds, generated-contract drift, public secret scan and infrastructure
  lint. `make test-integration`: **247 passed**, including migration/rollback,
  normalized duplicate names, password reset races, idempotent initial activity,
  unchanged approval and the two-hour photo limit. `make eval-mock`: passed.
- `pnpm exec playwright test`: **61 passed**, with one new mobile menu test
  attempting to click the textarea through an overlapping menu. The test now
  clicks a visible heading outside the menu; no assertion or timeout was weakened.
  `pnpm exec playwright test tests/smoke/practice-start.spec.ts`: **4 passed**
  across desktop/mobile, covering startup and all menu dismissal assertions.
  Earlier fixture failures were fixed by keeping the administrator and learner
  in separate browser contexts; connection cleanup can no longer use learner
  permissions. The final full run passed every account, provider, navigation,
  photo, reference, retry and setup-recovery case.
- `make hooks-check`: passed all hooks, including the full pre-commit gate.
  The supplied root banner is excluded from staging.
- `docker compose -f infra/docker/compose.yaml build` and
  `sh scripts/container-smoke.sh math-practice-tutor:local`: passed. The smoke uses
  disposable synthetic storage and checks non-root startup, current migrations,
  SQLite integrity settings, HEIF/JPEG normalization, cryptography, bounded
  provider subprocess failure and API/UI/worker readiness without inference.
- Both existing local services were stopped. Their storage was moved, without
  reading its contents, into a private rollback archive under ignored `data/`.
  A fresh database was migrated through 0017, then both services were recreated
  with the rebuilt image. API/UI, worker readiness and unclaimed administrator
  setup passed. Both run image
  `sha256:dd39a98233a29c687550fc08f366530071bb60f2aa80a2dc6871c5c93f46f1e9`.
  A new private setup link was delivered only to the maintainer; no credentials,
  provider settings or learner work were inspected or committed.

No paid/live inference, model download, public deployment or live model-quality
claim. The maintainer must add/test Spark and select its active roles after setup.

### T36 — Continuous conversation and usable photo feedback (2026-09-08)

The maintainer authorized correcting the demonstrated photo rejection, lost
follow-up context, redundant submission actions, and long scrolling layout,
then rebuilding the existing local containers and pushing `main`. This explicitly
revises the former rule that every photo ambiguity blocks tutoring: only
uncertainty preventing reliable feedback on the relevant work should block it.
`AGENTS.md` and specification sections 3 and 4 record the current contract.

Affected contracts and tests: photo interpretation eligibility and qualified
reader reports; bounded same-session message history and homework-reference
exclusion; conversational feedback schema and generated OpenAPI; accessible
composer, earlier activity history, photo attachment and session controls.
No database migration or new provider/service is required. Verification uses
synthetic fixtures; the supplied learner photos remain outside the repository.

Implemented behavior:

- A readable equation can proceed with a qualified sketch or incidental mark.
  Readability remains independent of correctness. A material ambiguity receives
  a specific explanation and repair request; uncertain counts cannot be inferred
  from the expected answer. Advice about presentation is optional.
- Follow-ups receive up to twelve recent exchanges from the same session,
  including earlier activities and explicitly uncertain rejected reader reports.
  Original assignment references remain excluded from review. The text tutor
  receives the reader report, not a claim that it has direct image access.
- Tutor instructions address the latest question directly and calibrate detail
  to the activity goal, difficulty and demonstrated understanding. Praise,
  concepts and next steps need not be manufactured for diagnostic questions.
- Practice has one Send action, a bounded conversation, a stable composer,
  compact attachment/help/next-activity controls, and secondary session/material
  controls beside it on desktop and above it on mobile. Earlier exchanges remain
  visible. Reader details and response metadata collapse separately. Failed
  readings no longer offer a misleading cancel button labeled as dismissal.
- Container smoke checks the current canonical JPEG normalization contract;
  it previously still expected the pre-T35 PNG format.

Validation:

- `make check test-integration smoke eval-mock
PNPM='pnpm --store-dir /tmp/math-tutor-pnpm-store'`: source checks/builds,
  contract drift, secret scan and infrastructure lint passed; **181 unit,
  145 component and 238 integration tests passed**. The browser suite ran all
  56 cases: 54 passed and two stopped at the old phone-help navigation path.
  Those tests now open Attach photo before opening its help. No timeout or
  assertion was weakened.
- `make build eval-mock` and `pnpm exec playwright test
tests/smoke/navigation.spec.ts tests/smoke/conversation.spec.ts
tests/smoke/tutor.spec.ts`: **18 passed** across desktop/mobile Chromium,
  including both previously failing cases, after rebuilding the corrected
  layout. New geometry assertions keep the Send button inside the chat frame.
  Synthetic screenshots were inspected. The deterministic evaluation passed.
- `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `git diff --check`, and
  `sh -n scripts/container-smoke.sh`: passed after the final corrections.
  The existing non-blocking Vite chunk-size warning remains.
- `docker compose -f infra/docker/compose.yaml build` and
  `sh scripts/container-smoke.sh math-practice-tutor:local`: passed. The final
  image passed isolated non-root API/UI/worker readiness, current migrations,
  SQLite settings, HEIF-to-JPEG normalization, cryptography and restricted
  provider subprocess checks, using disposable synthetic data and no inference.

`docker compose -f infra/docker/compose.yaml up -d --no-build api worker`
updated both existing services to image `894aed8c43cf`. API/UI and worker
readiness passed. Existing data/configuration were retained; no schema migration
was required for this change.

The maintainer's subsequent account/setup review is separate follow-up work.
No private operator files, uploads or logs were opened, and no live/paid model
calls were initiated. Real handwriting quality and a physical phone retest remain
maintainer checks; synthetic routing tests cannot establish model quality.

### T24 follow-up — QR links in an already signed-in phone tab (2026-09-08)

The maintainer reported needing to sign out on the phone before opening a camera
QR link. Reproduced with a synthetic signed-in browser: opening `/#capture=…`
in the existing document left the heading at **Practice**, because `main.tsx`
selected the capture screen only at page load. This establishes a browser
navigation defect; physical iPhone behavior still needs maintainer verification.

Contracts and checks: T24 scoped camera delegation and fragment-secret handling;
T02 browser-session preservation; initial load, same-document hash/history
navigation, replacement/canceled links, receipt reset, and upload authentication.
No backend API, schema, provider prompt, or tutoring-policy change. Required gates:
`make check`, `make test-integration`, `make smoke`, and `make eval-mock`.

Changes:

- `apps/web/src/Entry.tsx`, `photo-authority.ts`, and `main.tsx`: handle capture
  navigation while the app is running, scrub the secret before ordinary app
  navigation handles the event, keep it only in memory, and remount the camera
  component for a new link so prior receipts/errors cannot block a fresh upload.
- `apps/web/src/client.ts`: scoped photo uploads omit login cookies and CSRF
  headers; a photo authorization failure does not invalidate the browser login.
- `apps/web/tests/Entry.test.tsx`, `client.test.tsx`, and
  `tests/smoke/phone-navigation.spec.ts`: regression coverage for initial and
  reused signed-in tabs, duplicate navigation events, canceled/replacement links,
  upload and receipt, missing secret after reload, and retained sign-in.
- `docs/PHONE_SETUP.md`: explicitly explain that an already signed-in phone can
  remain signed in when using the QR link.
- `eslint.config.js`: exclude root private runtime directories, matching the
  repository data boundary. The first full gate stopped at `EACCES` while ESLint
  attempted to enumerate `data`; the exclusions allow source checks without
  accessing private runtime files or weakening any lint rule.

Validation:

- `pnpm exec playwright test tests/smoke/phone-navigation.spec.ts --project
desktop-chromium` after `make build`: **1 failed before the fix**, with
  **Practice** shown instead of **Photograph your work.**
- `pnpm --filter @math-tutor/web test tests/Entry.test.tsx tests/client.test.tsx
tests/PhoneCapture.test.tsx`: **21 passed**.
- `pnpm exec playwright test tests/smoke/phone-navigation.spec.ts` after
  rebuilding: **2 passed**, desktop and mobile Chromium. The browser retains
  its original document and authenticated session, replaces a canceled link,
  uploads a synthetic fixture without cookies/CSRF, and receives tutoring on
  the computer. Capture secrets appear in neither request URLs nor localStorage.
- `PATH=/home/mowll/.nvm/versions/node/v24.20.0/bin:$PATH
UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/shepard-uv-cache
PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome
make check test-integration smoke eval-mock
PNPM='pnpm --store-dir /tmp/math-tutor-pnpm-store'`: **passed**. Locked
  dependencies, lint/format, strict Python/TypeScript, builds, contract drift,
  credential scan and infrastructure lint passed; **179 unit, 143 component,
  234 integration, and 54 browser tests passed**. The deterministic mock
  evaluation passed. The existing non-blocking Vite chunk-size warning remains.
  A lint error in a new test callback was corrected before the final passing run;
  no lint rule or test assertion was disabled. `git diff --check` also passed.

Browser tests needed execution outside the socket-restricted sandbox and used
the disposable loopback server, temporary SQLite database, and synthetic provider.
No private operator files or stored learner work were opened. The supplied photos
were reviewed in the conversation only and were not copied into repository
fixtures. No live/paid provider calls, physical iPhone test, deployment, commit,
or push was performed.

### T35 — Photo submission and practice usability (2026-09-07)

Authorized scope: HEIC/HEIF picker and server conversion, drag-and-drop photos,
JPG failure repair, visible pending states, adjustable activity difficulty,
clearer adult practice-profile creation, and saved-session/logging guidance.
The maintainer also authorized API-supported thinking-effort controls.
The maintainer clarified that Practice needs simpler ordering: activity and
discussion first, grouped typed/photo response controls, hints and next-activity
choices, then secondary material/settings. Easier/Harder next-activity actions
save the selected difficulty atomically with the requested activity.

Contracts and checks: image preview/download MIME and provider image payloads;
migration `0015_normalized_jpeg` for saved image capabilities and invalidated
old test evidence; typed tutor session/settings difficulty
and selected Meta reasoning effort; migration `0016_reasoning_effort` for
content-free model-call/probe effort metadata; operation error code
and retryability; component and browser upload/practice/pairing tests; on-disk
migration, worker failure, persistence and authorization tests. Required gates:
`make check`, `make test-integration`, and affected browser workflows.

Synthetic reproduction: a 4,070,467-byte JPEG expanded to a 12,574,813-byte PNG
and a 16,766,420-byte base64 payload in the old path. Bounded JPEG normalization
removes that expansion. This establishes a real request-size defect, but cannot
prove the exact private live failure; no private logs or learner files were read.
The small photo probe is intentionally only an acceptance check. Real model
quality and physical phone/filesystem picker behavior require maintainer testing.

Implemented behavior:

- Explicit HEIC/HEIF extensions in the picker, shared single-file drag/drop and
  selection handling, bounded server decoding, JPEG preview/storage/provider
  payloads, and no unnecessary browser re-encoding without edits. Synthetic
  direct-upload and preview/upload fixture hashes remain strictly allowlisted.
- The configured Model response limit applies to all AI tutor calls and tests,
  including photo readings (16,384 by default). The photo test still uses one
  tiny synthetic image; its former 1,200-token cap no longer conflicts with
  explicitly selected thinking effort.
- Meta Thinking effort supports Provider default (omitted), Minimal, Low, Medium,
  High and Xhigh. The [official Meta reasoning cookbook](https://github.com/meta-models/meta-model-cookbook/blob/main/01_api_fundamentals/06_reasoning_tokens.ipynb)
  documents Xhigh as equivalent to High and does not assert a fixed default.
  Unsupported adapters reject non-default effort rather than silently ignoring
  it. Save/reopen, wire parameters, reported reasoning-token counts, diagnostic
  persistence, worker selection and readiness invalidation have synthetic tests.
- Practice groups text/photo input before hints and next-activity controls,
  places material selection before secondary session settings, and hides
  successful internal generation operations from the conversation. Failed
  operations remain visible with safe codes and honest retry availability.
- Easier/Standard/Harder persist with the session; direct next-activity controls
  change difficulty atomically, preserve request identity on retry, reject
  conflicting active work, and feed tested generator/reviewer instructions.
- Accessible pending spinners identify preparing, reading and tutoring states.
  Saved-session status is visible. Create my practice profile prefills the
  administrator login and adult eligibility while preserving editable naming.
- Operational SQLite records retain model IDs/errors and available timing/token
  metadata; session text stays in History, not copied into diagnostic logs.
  Help explains the existing 30-day history and photo retention, plus the absence
  of a separate concerning-message archive or alert system. Phone pairing and
  camera-only links retain their existing ownership/authorization boundaries.
- Migration 0015 clears old readiness proofs while preserving test diagnostics
  and sessions. Retest connections after upgrading. Old failed photos should be
  submitted afresh under the updated approved route, not replayed across policy
  changes.

Validation:

- `PATH=/home/mowll/.nvm/versions/node/v24.20.0/bin:$PATH
UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/shepard-uv-cache make check test-integration
PNPM='pnpm --store-dir /tmp/math-tutor-pnpm-store'`: passed all locked dependency,
  formatting/lint, strict Python/TypeScript, build, regenerated-contract,
  credential scan and IaC checks; **179 unit, 137 component and 234 integration
  tests passed**. Migrations used temporary on-disk SQLite databases.
  The existing Vite large-chunk warning remains non-blocking.
- The sandbox blocked loopback socket setup; synthetic socket checks ran with
  that restriction lifted. An overlapping browser setup rebuild temporarily
  removed the shared frontend assets during integration tests; the final gates
  ran sequentially and passed. No test requirement was weakened.
- Initial browser validation caught a missing rendered space in the saved
  difficulty label and stale `Me` expectations after login-name prefill. The
  rendered text and explicit expected login name were corrected. Strict checks
  also caught untyped JSON test assertions and incomplete generated-type fixtures;
  these were corrected before the final passing gates.
- Browser tests exposed an intermittent probe HTTP 503: a worker write between
  deferred configuration reads and diagnostic updates invalidated the SQLite
  snapshot. Probe revalidation and diagnostic updates now share a short immediate
  write transaction, committed before inference. The deterministic concurrent-write
  regression `test_probe_diagnostics_do_not_upgrade_a_stale_read_snapshot` failed
  with HTTP 503 before the fix and passed with HTTP 200 afterward. The focused
  pytest invocation (`-k stale_read_snapshot`) produced 1 failed before, 1 passed
  after; the final full integration run includes it. Browser fixture cleanup now
  removes its own synthetic connection even after a failed assertion.
- `PATH=/home/mowll/.nvm/versions/node/v24.20.0/bin:$PATH
UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/shepard-uv-cache
PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome make smoke
PNPM='pnpm --store-dir /tmp/math-tutor-pnpm-store'`: **52 passed in 4.0 minutes**
  with no retries. Includes native setup/restart, terms restoration, provider
  errors, Meta thinking selector, desktop/mobile layout, separate adult practice,
  learner-only pairing/revocation, phone-to-desktop photos, session/history resume,
  drag/drop reference photos, difficulty and uncertain-image handling. Synthetic
  desktop/mobile Practice screenshots were inspected as supplementary UI evidence.
- No live provider calls, model downloads, deployment, or access to private
  operator configuration, uploads, learner data, or logs was performed. Physical
  HEIC picker/camera behavior and real provider quality remain unverified.

### T34 — Observable tutor failures and configurable response budgets (2026-09-07)

Restarting did not resolve the maintainer's Spark tutor failure.
The supplied response was HTTP 422 with `code=incomplete_output`; this confirms
a non-normal model completion, not a connectivity diagnosis. The former code
conflated token exhaustion and other finish reasons and the UI hid that code.
The exact remote finish reason was not retained, so token exhaustion remains a
likely cause, not a verified live result. The T32 strict-schema correction did
not establish that the maintainer's live request succeeded.

Scope and acceptance:

- Replace the 1,200-token tutor probe and 1,600-token practice budgets with one
  saved, editable response limit (16,384 default; 64–131,072 bounds), enforced
  alongside the configured context window. Keep photo reading independently
  bounded. Preserve strict JSON validation and the two-request test budget;
  align each probe's timeout with practice's 90 seconds (180 seconds total).
- Distinguish output exhaustion, refusal and other incomplete responses, showing
  the failed phase and safe code directly in Connection tests.
- Persist content-free synthetic test attempts in SQLite via migration 0014:
  role, phase, status/code, allowlisted finish reason, HTTP status, requests
  started, response limit, timing.
  Display recent results after reload, cap at 20 per connection and expire at
  seven days. Never retain prompt/image/response content, keys or arbitrary
  provider error strings in diagnostics. Delete results with their connection.
- Restore saved terms review on reopening an unchanged connection; identity or
  audience changes still require a fresh acknowledgment.
- Verify HTTP adapter failures through the real API, durable outcome retention,
  migrations/rollback, adult authorization, component and browser workflows.

Implemented and verified:

- `adapters/providers/contracts.py`, `transports.py`, `execution.py`,
  `tutoring.py` and the provider API now share the saved response budget, preserve
  safe finish reasons across the process boundary, distinguish token exhaustion
  from other incomplete responses, and report which synthetic step failed.
  The default provider context budget now matches the browser's 32,768 default;
  explicitly saved context limits are preserved. Changing a saved budget
  invalidates its prior capability evidence through the existing fingerprint.
- `ProviderProbeResult`, migration `0014_probe_results`, retention and connection
  deletion persist bounded diagnostics. A failed request commits its diagnostic
  independently of the HTTP rollback. Deleting a connection during inference
  returns the correct stale-configuration failure without recreating its records.
  Hostile error codes and finish reasons are replaced with fixed safe values.
- `ProviderConnections.tsx` and `client.ts` expose the response limit, show the
  latest test on its connection card, refresh persisted diagnostics on failure,
  retain earlier results across reloads and restore an existing terms review.
  OpenAPI and TypeScript contracts were regenerated with `make contracts`.
- `make check`: passed locks, formatting, lint, strict Python/TypeScript types,
  **163 backend unit** and **130 component** tests, both builds, generated-contract
  drift, tracked-secret scan and infrastructure lint. The existing non-fatal
  Vite chunk-size warning remains. Tools used the installed Node 24.20.0 and
  pnpm 12.3.4 via PATH; UV_CACHE_DIR pointed at a temporary writable cache.
- Final `make test-integration`: **226/226 passed**, including migration
  upgrade/downgrade preservation, metadata consistency, configurable limits,
  failure persistence, seven-day expiry, bounded history and deletion races.
- `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome pnpm exec playwright
test tests/smoke/connections.spec.ts`: **12/12 passed** on desktop and mobile.
  The real API/subprocess/HTTP workflow verifies a photo pass followed by truncated
  tutor feedback, retained error details after reload with no extra call,
  successful explicit retest, and the checked acknowledgment on reopening.
- Initial restricted checks could not create loopback sockets; approved synthetic
  checks passed outside the sandbox. The bundled Playwright executable was absent,
  so the checked-in executable override used installed Chrome. One browser
  assertion initially observed an old photo pass before the new request ended;
  it now waits for the new success acknowledgment before checking exact call counts.
  Migration-head assertions were updated for 0014. A concurrent Vite rebuild
  temporarily removed assets during one integration fixture setup; the final
  integration run after the completed build passed without changing the test.
- `git diff --check`: passed. No live Meta/other provider inference, private
  configuration/log access, operator-database migration, model download, Git
  push or deployment was performed. The maintainer must stop the app, apply
  `make migrate start`, refresh and explicitly retest Spark; live success is
  not claimed from synthetic fixtures.

### T33 — Contextual connection-save failures (2026-09-07)

The maintainer deleted a Spark connection, tried to add it again, and received a
generic validation warning below the entire saved-connection list while an older
success notice remained visible. The visible Meta URL, model, audience and
250,000-token context value all satisfy the current backend schema. The agent did
not inspect the private API key, database or running process; an older API process
is a strong explanation because the former backend rejected context limits above
131,072 while the newer static page accepts them.

Bounded implementation and acceptance:

- Put a failed save inside its connection editor immediately above the action
  buttons. Name the connection and preserve only safe, actionable server details;
  remove the vague **Your entries are still here** text.
- When a generic running API rejects a context value above the former 131,072
  bound, explicitly tell the operator to restart so the page and API run the same
  version. Continue to keep credentials and arbitrary server details out of errors.
- Reject spaces, line breaks and non-ASCII characters in a replacement API key in
  the browser before submission, matching backend validation without displaying
  the key.
- Close an editor when its connection and stored key are deleted. Make deletion
  confirmation explicit, dismiss app success notices, and clear obsolete notices
  when moving to another Settings step.
- Keep the provider CRUD contract unchanged and exercise only synthetic fixtures;
  make no live provider call and inspect no operator state.

Implemented and verified:

- The current `ProviderConnectionCreate` and `ProviderConfig` models accepted a
  synthetic copy of every visible value in the report, including `250000`; this
  establishes that the displayed fields are not invalid on current `main` without
  making a network request.
- Focused ProviderConnections and AdultPanel component coverage passed **53/53**.
  The full affected browser file passed **12/12** across desktop and mobile,
  including a real backend rejection whose exact URL rule renders inside the
  editor. An initial service-worker-intercept test was invalid because the PWA
  handled the request before Playwright routing; it was replaced with the real
  synthetic backend case and did not weaken an assertion.
- `make test` passed **163 backend unit** and **123 frontend component** cases.
  Repository hooks, lint, formatting, strict types, both production builds,
  generated-contract drift and tracked-secret checks passed. The existing Vite
  large-chunk warning remains non-fatal and was not hidden. The integration suite
  was not rerun because this slice changes no backend or generated API contract;
  its prior T32 result is 217/217.
- Push evidence is recorded before handoff. No live Meta request, private
  configuration access, model download, migration, phone test or deployment was
  performed.

### T32 — Tutor probe compatibility and clear save feedback (2026-09-07)

The maintainer observed a saved Spark connection whose photo-reader test passed
while its tutor test received an HTTP 400, and reported that connection saves
lacked an obvious confirmation while unrelated form changes repeatedly cleared
the provider-terms checkbox. The two roles deliberately have independent
capability evidence, but the screen did not explain their different contracts.

Bounded implementation and acceptance:

- Keep separate tutor and photo-reader probes: a photo pass must not silently
  certify tutoring. Explain that photo reading is one image response while the
  tutor probe checks activity creation and feedback in two text responses.
- Correct OpenAI-style native structured-output schemas so every declared field
  is required, nullable values remain nullable, defaults are removed from the
  wire copy, objects remain closed, and the local typed schema is not mutated.
- Show a visible, dismissible, accessible confirmation after saving a connection.
  Replace the inaccurate post-failure label **Not run** with **Not passed yet**.
- Preserve the terms review across key, capability, enabled, context-window and
  structured-output changes. Continue to require a fresh review when the provider
  identity or covered users change: connection type, model, server or audience.
- Add focused provider-wire, component and desktop/mobile workflow regressions;
  make no live provider call and do not inspect private configuration.

Implemented and verified:

- OpenAI-compatible native requests now recursively close a copied response
  schema, require every declared property and remove `default` annotations. This
  repairs the tutor feedback schema's nullable `uncertainty_note`; the already
  fully-required photo schema explains why the observed photo probe could pass
  while the tutor's second request was rejected. Local validation is unchanged.
- Connection tests now explain partial role readiness and say **Not passed yet**.
  Connection saves display a fixed, dismissible `role=status` toast after moving
  to the next setup step.
- Technical edits no longer clear the provider-terms checkbox. Provider/model/
  server/audience changes still clear it, preserving T29's audience-review rule.
- `make test` passed **163 backend unit tests** and **120 frontend component
  tests**. `make test-integration` passed **217/217**. The affected
  `tests/smoke/connections.spec.ts` passed **10/10** desktop/mobile Chromium
  cases, including the save toast and retained acknowledgment. The first
  restricted test attempts could not open loopback fixture sockets/processes;
  the identical gates passed with loopback access.
- Production build, formatting, lint, typing, generated-contract drift and tracked
  secret checks passed through the repository gates. The build retains the
  existing non-fatal bundle-size warning. No live provider request, private
  configuration access, model download, migration, physical-phone test or cloud
  deployment was performed. The maintainer's live tutor retest remains the final
  confirmation for their exact Spark account/model ID.

### T31 — Visible connection repair and current Meta defaults (2026-09-07)

The maintainer found that a failed Spark test warning followed them across every
Settings tab and that connection editing was hidden under technical details. The
saved connection name `spark` is valid. Meta's current official direct Model API
cookbook uses `https://api.meta.ai/v1`, model `muse-spark-1.3`, a 1,048,576-token
context window, image input, and Chat Completions structured output.

Bounded implementation and acceptance:

- Show Edit connection without requiring a technical-details disclosure, including
  directly beside failed connection tests.
- Keep a test failure on the Connection tests tab and identify which connection
  failed. Do not carry that warning into another Settings step.
- Prefill new Meta connections with the current official direct-API model ID,
  context window and photo capability. Keep the model editable for IDs explicitly
  listed by the operator's Meta account, and offer a one-click canonical repair for
  existing entries.
- Add focused component coverage, run applicable repository gates, inspect the
  public diff, and make no live provider call or private-configuration access.

Implemented and verified:

- Edit connection is visible on every browser-managed saved-connection card and
  beside its Connection tests; it no longer requires opening technical details.
- Test failures name the affected connection and render only in Connection tests.
  Editing from the test card opens the populated Connections editor directly.
- New Meta connections prefill `muse-spark-1.3`, a 1,048,576-token context and
  photo support. Existing Meta entries keep their saved model ID and show a
  one-click `muse-spark-1.3` repair while remaining editable.
- `make hooks-check build contracts-check secret-check` passed: **162 backend unit
  tests**, **115 component tests**, locked dependency, lint, formatting, type,
  contract drift, production build and tracked-secret gates. The build retains the
  existing non-fatal bundle-size warning.
- The affected `tests/smoke/connections.spec.ts` passed **10/10** desktop/mobile
  Chromium cases using only synthetic fixtures. No integration suite was rerun
  because this task changes only frontend display/defaults and documentation. No
  live provider call, private configuration access, model download, physical-phone
  test or cloud deployment was performed.

### T30 — Guided AI setup and truthful context windows (2026-09-07)

The maintainer found that a newly saved Spark connection remained greyed out in
the provider selectors, while the app-wide permissions and connection tests that
block assignment were hidden in other collapsed sections. They also found that the
generic 131,072-token validation ceiling rejects Spark's larger documented context.

Bounded implementation and acceptance:

- Separate connection editing, app-wide permissions, synthetic connection tests,
  and active tutor/photo assignment into clearly named settings sections with an
  explicit **save → permissions → test → assign** sequence.
- Show every blocker on the affected connection or role, explain that policy is a
  global safety switch rather than part of one connection, and provide a direct
  action to the section that resolves it. Do not represent a merely untested
  connection as a mysteriously disabled option.
- Preserve explicit cloud authorization, synthetic-test confirmation, capability
  checks and final role authorization. Saving must still make no provider call and
  must not activate a route automatically.
- Raise the provider-neutral context-window contract to a justified bounded value
  that accepts 1,000,000 tokens and other currently supported large-context models.
  Keep frontend and backend validation aligned and reject values outside the bound.
- Add backend, component and desktop/mobile browser regressions for the main path
  and blocked path, regenerate contracts, run the applicable project gates, and use
  only synthetic fixtures. Do not inspect private configuration or call a live model.

Implemented:

- Split Settings into four keyboard-accessible tabs: Connections, App permissions,
  Connection tests, and Assign active connections. Saving directs the operator to
  the next missing step. Help and setup documentation follow the same sequence.
- Pending connections remain selectable. Assignment lists their exact permission,
  credential, capability and test blockers with direct navigation. Draft selections
  survive visits to other setup steps; activation still requires valid tests and
  explicit authorization. Tutor and photo-reader readiness are independent.
- Accept context windows from 2,048 through 2,147,483,647 consistently in the browser
  and provider schemas, including 1,000,000-token values. Actual request/output
  limits remain separately bounded. Regenerated the public API contract.
- Clarified the connection-name format, including the valid example `spark-1-3`.
- Added regression coverage for large-context persistence and rejected values,
  pending selections, separate role readiness, direct blocker links, keyboard tabs,
  and zero model calls or route activation when merely saving a connection.
- Final review reproduced a pre-existing intermittent 503 in concurrent phone
  retries. Deferred that endpoint's eager write lock until after image processing,
  retaining locked authorization/idempotency revalidation and releasing the lock
  before returning a duplicate receipt. This is a bounded transaction correction
  with no schema change; the existing concurrency assertions remain intact.

Verification:

- `make hooks-check build contracts-check secret-check infra-check` passed after
  correcting a browser-test type error and the partial-readiness status message.
  This includes locked dependency, lint, formatting, type, unit and component gates.
- Final code checks passed **162 backend unit tests** and **113 component tests**.
  The final hook run also includes the phone-upload correction below.
- The production build retains the existing non-fatal bundle-size warning.
- `pnpm exec playwright test tests/smoke/connections.spec.ts tests/smoke/navigation.spec.ts`
  passed **18/18** cases on desktop and mobile Chromium, using a synthetic local
  server and model fixtures. No real provider calls were made.
- `make test-integration` passed **217/217** after fixing the reproduced phone-upload
  lock. The unchanged `test_concurrent_phone_retry_and_changed_photo` regression
  passed **10/10** consecutive focused runs after the fix. Before correction, the
  full suite had one failure (**216 passed**) and the focused test reproduced the
  same `[503, 202]` result on its third run.
- `git diff --check` passed. Validation used Node 24.20.0, the repository's locked
  dependencies, an isolated uv cache, `UV_NO_ENV_FILE=true`, and system Chromium for
  Playwright. No live provider request, private configuration access, model download,
  physical-phone test or cloud deployment was performed. Live Spark verification
  remains the operator's next step after saving permissions and running its tests.

### T29 — Product identity and honest provider controls (2026-09-07)

The maintainer reported that the UI's obsolete tutor label does not match the
repository and that the **Where this model runs** and **Allowed users** dropdowns
do not work while adding a Meta connection. The selected product name is
**Shepherd Academy Universe**. In a follow-up, the maintainer explicitly rejected
the app's provider-specific age rule and chose a terms disclaimer plus
operator-selected audience instead. Meta's hosted boundary remains cloud-only.

Bounded implementation and acceptance:

- Replace the obsolete user-facing product name in the app shell, document title,
  install manifest, phone/setup copy, native startup output and public API/project
  descriptions. Keep established internal package/module/database identifiers to
  avoid an unrelated compatibility rename.
- For Meta, show its hosted cloud boundary as an explicit fixed value rather than
  a broken-looking dropdown. Make **Allowed users** editable and persist the
  operator's choice. Show a provider-specific age/data disclaimer and require the
  existing provider-terms acknowledgment, but do not hard-code an age restriction.
  Point to Ollama/vLLM for locally served Llama models.
- For Ollama, vLLM and compatible endpoints, retain real enabled selects and prove
  that both changed values reach the save request. Preserve backend enforcement
  of the selected audience, key/origin checks, explicit cloud consent and learner
  ownership.
- Add accessible component and browser regressions, run the focused checks and
  appropriate project gates, inspect the public diff, then record exact evidence.
  Use only synthetic fixtures; do not inspect the operator's provider settings or
  key and do not make a live model call.

Implemented:

- Renamed all user-visible product surfaces to **Shepherd Academy Universe** while
  retaining compatibility-sensitive package, database and deployment identifiers.
- Removed the Meta-specific audience validator and routing block. Meta now defaults
  to the editable mixed audience and uses the same selected-audience policy as every
  other provider; its hosted endpoint remains accurately fixed to cloud processing.
- Replaced the disabled location control with a labeled fixed value, added the
  provider-terms disclaimer and local Ollama/vLLM guidance, and kept the existing
  acknowledgment tied to every audience change.
- Added backend, component and desktop/mobile browser regressions proving Meta's
  mixed route, generic audience enforcement, fixed hosted location, editable saved
  audience, and usable Ollama/vLLM/compatible controls without provider calls.

Verification:

- `make hooks-check test-integration` passed: the repository hooks and full project
  check passed, followed by **216 integration tests**.
- Provider-focused suites passed: **50 backend unit tests**, **28 provider
  integration tests**, and **107 frontend component tests**.
- The affected Playwright cases passed on desktop and mobile Chromium: **4/4**.
- `git diff --check` passed. No live provider request, model download, private
  operator configuration, physical-phone test or cloud deployment was performed.

### T28 — Browser-first administrator setup (2026-09-07)

The maintainer requested browser-based account creation and less restrictive
local passwords after the terminal rejected a short password and stopped startup.
They authorized sensible refinements, verification, and a push to `main` before
providing updated local commands. This supersedes D010/specification section 12's
CLI-only first-account rule, not local ownership proof or authenticated access.

Contracts and bounded plan:

- Start an unclaimed private app without asking for credentials in the terminal.
  Print a short-lived, one-use owner setup link with its token in the fragment.
  Keep the token out of request URLs, browser storage, API responses and logs.
  First-account creation requires that token, same-origin CSRF and a transaction
  proving no administrator exists; it can never reset an existing account.
- A focused web setup page creates the adult account and signs it in. Explain
  password requirements before entry, keep recoverable errors inline, and leave
  the server running. Existing login, pairing and Help remain available.
- Allow six-character passwords for HTTP loopback-only use; retain twelve for
  HTTPS/phone/network deployment, with no composition rules. Store only a
  local-only-password flag (not length/plaintext) so enabling network access
  cannot silently expose an account created under the shorter policy. Existing
  accounts retain their credentials. Explicit local reset remains a recovery tool.
- Add typed setup/status APIs and a real migration for the password-policy flag;
  regenerate OpenAPI/TypeScript. Cover expired/missing tokens, replay/races,
  rollback, CSRF/origin, demo and network policy, and existing-account preservation.
- Parallel backend, browser UI and native-launcher slices; run targeted checks,
  full project/integration/browser gates sequentially where assets are shared,
  mock evaluation, public-file hooks and diff review. Record real first-run/restart
  evidence using isolated synthetic settings/data, then commit/push and observe CI.

No live operator settings, credentials, database, uploads or private logs may be
inspected or changed. No live inference, model download or deployment is in scope.

Implemented:

- `Setup.tsx`, `setup-authority.ts`, `main.tsx`, `App.tsx` and styles: focused
  first-account form with requirements before entry, matching/length/blank/control
  validation, automatic adult sign-in and Settings as the next page. The setup
  token is removed from the URL before React renders, kept only in page memory,
  and cleared after success/cancel or an existing account. Help preserves the
  form; reload/reopened/expired links have explicit recovery. Lost success
  receipts recover the committed session without issuing another setup claim.
- `api/setup.py`, `setup_gate.py`, auth API/service and application factory:
  typed setup/status routes; ephemeral hash-only thirty-minute owner authority;
  fixed redacted errors; existing Origin/CSRF and bounded rate controls. Hashing
  happens outside the short first-admin transaction, which rechecks the token
  and absence of accounts before committing the administrator and session.
  Replay/concurrent claims cannot reset an account; rollback leaves a valid link
  retryable. Raw malformed Unicode cannot cause unhandled encoding errors.
- `auth.py`, DB model and migration `0013_local_password_policy`: six-character
  HTTP loopback creation, twelve-character HTTPS creation, and a local-only
  flag for shorter passwords. Existing credentials remain untouched. Network
  login/session use rejects flagged accounts even outside the native launcher.
  Downgrade refuses to discard that protection until local-only passwords have
  been replaced with twelve or more characters.
- `local_start.py`, `scripts/dev.py` and CLI: normal startup no longer prompts
  for account credentials. Unclaimed private startup prints a fresh owner link
  after building; stale/inherited tokens are removed and the worker never gets
  setup authority. Existing accounts receive no new link. HTTPS startup refuses
  a local-only account with recovery instructions. Explicit `make admin` announces
  bounds and allows interactive correction rather than exiting after one typo.
- README, Help, PHONE_SETUP, RUNBOOK, specification, D011, THREAT_MODEL and HANDOFF
  describe browser-first setup, later restarts, expired-link recovery and the
  local/network password tradeoff. OpenAPI and TypeScript contracts regenerated.

Targeted verification: backend setup/auth/migration 117 cases passed in 11.00 s;
final auth units 28 passed in 0.44 s; startup/supervisor 46 cases passed in 0.88 s;
Setup/App component cases 32 passed. Scoped Ruff, formatting, mypy, TypeScript,
ESLint and diff checks passed. The first full gate caught a test-only unused
`async`; it was corrected, not suppressed. All runtime tests use isolated synthetic
state.

Final local evidence before the authorized commit/push:

- `make hooks-check check` passed: public-file pre-commit hooks; lock/toolchain
  checks; Ruff/formatting; mypy (64 source files); TypeScript; 159 API unit tests
  (9.02 s); 103 component tests; API/web builds; generated-contract drift; public
  credential scan; and CloudFormation lint. Node 24.20.0, pnpm 12.3.4 and Python
  3.14.7 were used. The existing Vite large-chunk warning remains non-fatal; its
  threshold was not raised or hidden.
- `make test-integration smoke eval-mock` passed sequentially: 215 integration
  cases (25.82 s), all 46 desktop/mobile browser cases (3.6 min), and 33 rational
  plus 30 mock-vision fixtures with a passing report. Chrome was the installed
  `/usr/bin/google-chrome`; no browser or model download was performed.
- The four new native-browser cases execute the real `make start ENV_FILE=...`
  against temporary synthetic settings and SQLite with no terminal input. They
  cover visitor denial without the owner link, fragment removal, inline short
  password/mismatch correction while the service stays healthy, successful
  six-character creation, lost-success-response recovery, stale-link rejection,
  no token in request URLs/storage, and restart/session/login persistence on
  desktop and mobile. The two setup screenshots were inspected for layout only;
  they are not correctness evidence or physical-phone verification.
- Independent slice review led to malformed-Unicode protection, downgrade refusal
  while local-only accounts exist, reopened-link status refresh, and committed
  setup-session recovery. The affected regression cases pass. Staged whitespace
  and public credential checks passed; generated files were regenerated, not
  hand-edited.
- Operator settings, database and credentials were not inspected or changed.
  No live-provider inference, physical-phone check, model download, cloud
  provisioning or public deployment was run. Hosted CI is checked after pushing;
  it is not counted as local evidence here.

### T27 — Complete local setup and browser-managed AI connections (2026-09-07)

The maintainer found that Settings could select providers but could not add an
API key, Ollama server, or vLLM endpoint, and requested closing that gap and
related setup blockers, pushing `main`, then giving verified local run steps.
The earlier T26 navigation redesign did not complete the first-run workflow.

Bounded scope and contracts:

- Adult-only typed connection create/read/update/delete, write-only credentials,
  explicit cloud/audience policy, and existing separately authorized probes and
  route selection. No connection save performs inference or enables a route.
- Persist connections and encrypted credentials in the existing private SQLite
  database with a real migration. API and worker reload effective configuration;
  configuration/key changes invalidate previous probe and queued-policy state.
- Retain file-managed configuration without rewriting operator files; learner
  sessions cannot manage credentials, endpoints, or policy. No browser storage,
  response/error echo, or learner export may expose keys. Preserve server-side
  destination, age, capability, consent, demo and request-budget enforcement.
- A normal persistent local launcher loads settings without shell evaluation,
  creates only missing setup, checks readiness before building, and creates an
  adult account only when none exists. Restarts never reset accounts or data.
  Retained database upgrades remain an explicit stopped-write operation.
- Update Settings and Help together: add connection → authorized test → choose
  tutor/photo roles → practice. Show unavailable/managed-policy states honestly.

Plan/evidence gates: parallel backend persistence/API, frontend connection form,
and local launcher slices; regenerate OpenAPI/TypeScript; add synthetic component,
real on-disk authorization/credential/rollback tests and real browser workflow
tests with a local synthetic model server. Run targeted checks, `make check`,
`make test-integration`, `make smoke`, `make eval-mock`, `make hooks-check`, public
diff review, commit/push and hosted CI. Results will be recorded before handoff.
No live `.env`, credentials, provider configuration, learner database or private
logs will be inspected. No paid inference, model download or deployment is in scope.

Implemented:

- `ProviderConnections.tsx`, `AdultPanel.tsx`, `client.ts` and Help: adult Settings
  now adds/edits Ollama, vLLM, compatible API and Meta connections, with a password
  field for write-only keys. Setup is save → explicit synthetic test → choose
  Tutor/Photo reader → authorize routes. Connection save never calls a model.
  Contextual instructions, advanced settings, cloud/audience controls, managed
  policy locks, and actionable redacted connection errors cover the same workflow.
  API keys are cleared on save/cancel/navigation and never stored in the browser.
- `api/provider_connections.py`, `provider_secrets.py`, provider configuration,
  transport and DB models, plus migration `0012_provider_connections`: typed
  admin/CSRF-only CRUD and policy; encrypted server-side key persistence with
  purpose-separated HKDF/AES-GCM and connection-ID authentication. API and worker
  reload saved configuration without restarting. Secret rotation fails closed
  while leaving Settings available to replace affected keys. File-managed
  providers remain read-only; collisions cannot shadow them.
- `api/providers.py`: tutor tests now exercise the current activity and feedback
  schemas (two synthetic calls); photo tests exercise the current reading schema
  (one known synthetic image). Existing deadlines, seven-day expiry, call limits,
  principal/policy checks and destination validation remain enforced. Recheck
  authorization before each call; changing a selected connection invalidates its
  tests and requires fresh route consent, including while work is queued.
- `local_start.py`, `cli.py` and Makefile: persistent `make start` safely loads
  private settings without shell evaluation, creates missing setup and the first
  account only, checks prerequisites before building, rejects duplicate launchers,
  and preserves accounts/data on Ctrl+C/restart. Existing database upgrades remain
  explicit. Captured dotenv diagnostics cannot echo malformed secret lines.
  Operator migration/admin/worker/backup/restore commands use the same settings
  loader; backup/restore retain stopped-write and no-overwrite requirements.
- README, PHONE_SETUP, RUNBOOK, PROVIDER_STATUS, specification, D010 and HANDOFF:
  normal local setup and web connection configuration are documented together;
  YAML is advanced/optional, cloud use stays explicit, and key recovery/backup
  limitations are stated. The historical pre-D005 hard cutover is distinguished
  from normal current-schema migrations.

Observed verification with Node 24.20.0/pnpm 12.3.4 selected from the existing
installation, `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/shepard-t27-uv-cache`, and `UV_NO_ENV_FILE=true`:

- Final `make check` passed: locks, lint/format, strict types, 145 Python unit tests,
  80 component tests, API/PWA builds, generated contract drift, credential scan
  and IaC lint. The existing Vite chunk-size warning remains; its threshold was
  not raised. Backup-loader checks are included in this final run.
- Final `make test-integration`: 188 passed in 24.02 s, including 27 connection
  and 15 startup integration cases with on-disk SQLite, rollback/downgrade, current
  schemas, revocation, stale-policy and worker coverage. Socket/process gates
  ran outside the sandbox using only isolated synthetic state.
- Final `make smoke`: 42 desktop/mobile Chromium cases passed in 3.4 min. New
  cases configure Ollama, vLLM and compatible endpoints through the real UI,
  prove no call on save or cancelled testing, authenticate bounded schema tests,
  save roles, reload and generate practice through the worker without restart.
  Rejected-key responses deliberately contain a fixture secret; the UI displays
  actionable safe advice without echoing it. Paired learners cannot view or
  change connection settings. Test fixtures are stopped and routes restored.
- `make eval-mock` passed all 63 synthetic cases (`passed: true`).
- Actual PTY `make start ENV_FILE=/tmp/shepard-t27-startup.Z1J684/.env` with
  isolated synthetic database/data and loopback port 56079: first start created
  missing settings, initialized the database and prompted for one administrator.
  Live/ready/login all returned 200. Ctrl+C stopped API/worker and released the
  port. Repeating the exact command did not prompt/reset the administrator; the
  existing browser session and same-password login still worked. Final Ctrl+C
  stopped all synthetic services. Generated private settings were not inspected.
- Visual inspection of synthetic Settings and connection entry at 1280px and
  390px showed no horizontal overflow. This is layout evidence only. Independent
  review verified secret serialization, destination pinning, consent and demo
  boundaries, and found/fixed dotenv diagnostic leaks, per-call revocation,
  route reapproval and the `.env`-only backup path gap with regression tests.
- Backup-loader targeted checks passed 37 startup/supervisor cases in 0.72 s.
  They prove `.env`-only custom database settings reach both backup and restore,
  malformed settings cannot echo secrets, and active native writes are refused.
  The underlying backup command is stubbed in these dispatcher cases; existing
  integration tests cover actual encrypted backup/restore behavior.
- `make hooks-check`, the staged-public-file credential scan and
  `git diff --cached --check` passed. Final diff review found no secrets, learner
  data, generated contract drift, silent cloud fallback or infrastructure change.
- One parallel gate run passed 187 integration cases but hit a fixture setup
  error while Vite briefly replaced the shared generated assets directory.
  Rerunning the unchanged full integration gate after the build passed all 188;
  build and integration gates must run sequentially in this shared checkout.

No operator `.env`, provider configuration, retained database,
uploads or private logs were opened or changed in this implementation turn.
Live provider/model quality, paid inference, physical phones, model downloads
and deployment were not tested or performed. Hosted CI will be observed after
the authorized push.

### T26 — Purposeful pages and guided setup (2026-09-07)

The maintainer rated the crowded workflow 3/10 and authorized a redesign and
push to `main`. Scope: tab-style page navigation for Practice, History, Learners
& devices, Settings, and Help; plain wording; useful empty/disabled states;
contextual help and explicit phone pairing versus camera-upload instructions.
Browser research belongs under advanced settings, outside the practice path.

The maintainer clarified that the parent may also be the student. Keep adult
account permissions separate from each person's learner profile. Include an
explicit Add yourself path under the existing adult sign-in; child profiles
retain paired browser access without admin controls or separate passwords.

Contracts: existing typed authentication, learner ownership, tutoring, provider,
photo and pairing APIs; public URL navigation and in-memory draft/retry state.
No API/schema change or migration is planned. Preserve automatic clear-photo
reading before feedback, reference-only assignments, server capability checks,
explicit provider consent and retry identities. Historical screen names in the
specification are refined by the maintainer's current page request.

Plan: implement the shell/help and bounded practice/admin pages in parallel,
adapt browser tests to the real navigation, and add regression coverage for
page separation, back navigation, contextual help, retained drafts, pairing,
and learner-only navigation. Run targeted checks, `make check`,
`make test-integration`, `make smoke`, and `make eval-mock`; inspect the public
diff, commit, push `main`, and observe hosted CI. Record actual results below.

Implemented:

- `App.tsx`, `navigation.ts`, and `styles.css`: semantic page links styled as
  tabs, role-appropriate navigation, page titles/focus, browser Back, and
  retained in-memory practice state. Setup/settings no longer share the practice
  screen. Explicit page changes scroll to the top; Help topics have their own
  links. Private session IDs remain fragments rather than server requests.
- `Tutor.tsx`, `PhoneLink.tsx`, and `PhotoInput.tsx`: separate History and focused
  current activity; plain tutor-style controls; contextual topic/reference/photo
  help; setup actions beside unavailable tutoring; visible processing labels.
  Drafts, photo previews and retry keys survive page changes. Hints do not clear
  unsent text, and session/learner changes protect pending work.
- `AdultPanel.tsx`: separate learner/device and provider pages, explicit one-photo
  QR versus full learner pairing guidance, Add yourself for adult students,
  contextual age/provider explanations, controlled data consent and connection
  tests. Data export/revocation/deletion and the browser experiment are secondary
  controls. Delayed learner creation/deletion cannot select a learner after
  leaving that page; a failed learner list can be retried with Reconnect.
- `Help.tsx`, README, PHONE_SETUP, HANDOFF and specification: in-app getting
  started, account/profile model, private setup, phone HTTPS, model configuration,
  troubleshooting and privacy guidance. Corrected the earlier misleading demo
  path: public demo mode blocks tutoring/personal photos and links to private
  setup. No existing privacy/capability restriction was relaxed.

Observed verification with Node 24.20.0/pnpm 12.3.4 selected from the existing
Node installation and `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/shepard-t26-uv-cache`:

- Final `make check` passed: locked dependencies, lint/format, strict types,
  125 Python unit tests, 51 component tests, API/PWA builds, generated contract
  drift, tracked credential scan and IaC lint. The existing Vite main-chunk size
  warning remains; no threshold was raised.
- `make test-integration`: 146 passed in 19.94 s. The sandbox could not complete
  async integration requests or bind unit-test loopback sockets; the affected
  gates passed outside it using only isolated synthetic data.
- `make eval-mock` passed all 63 synthetic cases (`passed: true`).
- Final `make smoke`: all 36 desktop/mobile Chromium cases passed in 2.7 min,
  including parent-as-student, saved-session Back, retained drafts, full learner
  pairing/revocation, phone photos, and reference-only assignment coverage.
- The first expanded browser run passed 35/36 cases; its extra fast sign-ins hit
  the production ten-per-minute login limit. The shared test helper now validates
  the 429 response and bounded `Retry-After`, waits that delay and retries once.
  It does not bypass or raise the application's rate limit.
- `make hooks-check` passed the public-file and project hooks. After staging new
  files, `make secret-check` and `git diff --cached --check` passed.
- Visual inspection of the real synthetic app at 1280px and 390px covered
  Practice, current activity and phone Help. This is layout evidence only.
  Independent review found and fixed delayed learner-selection, learner-list
  retry, session Back/URL, and Help-scroll defects, with regression coverage.

Live provider/model evaluation, model downloads, private operator setup and
physical phone testing were not run. No backend contract or migration changed.
The maintainer's authorization covers committing and pushing this public code,
not inference or deployment. Hosted checks will be observed after pushing.

### T16/T19 — Beta-readiness retention and worker review (2026-09-07)

The maintainer authorized closing the review's software gaps and pushing the
reviewed result to `main`. Scope: reliable deletion after filesystem failures,
photo expiry independent of cleanup, and worker recovery from temporary database
or storage errors. Public API schemas and provider policy remain unchanged.

Contracts and regression plan:

- Migration `0011_photo_deletion` stores only pending opaque storage keys and
  timestamps, atomically with learner/history purges. Retry after restart,
  rollback, duplicate scheduling, malformed keys and crash-after-unlink are tested
  against temporary on-disk SQLite; filesystem deletion holds no queue write lock.
- Failed learner/history/orphan photo cleanup must not prevent another learner's
  work from completing. Expired photos are inaccessible through the API and never
  read for inference, even if the file cannot yet be removed.
- The long-running worker retries operational database/storage errors with bounded
  waits and safe warnings; `--once` fails honestly. Durable leases and call budgets
  continue to own recovery, with no direct replay of a provider call.
- Targeted tests, followed by `make check`, `make test-integration`, `make smoke`,
  `make eval-mock`, public-file review and observed hosted CI after publication.

Verification on synthetic data:

- Targeted retention/workflow/schema/auth tests: 120 passed. The final complete
  integration gate, including five additional malformed cleanup-key cases:
  `make test-integration`, 146 passed. Migration upgrade/downgrade, rollback and
  schema-drift checks passed.
- `make check` passed: formatting/lint, strict Python/TypeScript checks, 125 Python
  unit tests, 33 component tests, API/PWA builds, generated contract checks,
  tracked-text credential scan and infrastructure validation. Its initial strict
  type failure in the new test's time monkeypatch was corrected without weakening
  checks. The existing Vite main-chunk size warning remains.
- `make smoke`: all 28 desktop/mobile Chromium browser tests passed.
  `make eval-mock`: passed for the 63 synthetic evaluation fixtures.
- `git diff --check` passed. Public tracked-file review found no learner data or
  credentials. Existing Git author metadata includes a personal name/email;
  this is distinct from application data, and history has not been rewritten.
  GitHub reports the repository public. The new commit uses GitHub's noreply
  address. Hosted CI is to be observed after pushing; local container validation
  was unavailable because Docker is not installed.

These gates support handing the software to the maintainer as its first beta
tester, not a claim of production acceptance. Live provider/model quality,
physical iPhone testing and private operator configuration remain unverified;
no live inference, model download or deployment was performed. Apply migration
`0011_photo_deletion` with API/worker writes stopped before using this version.

### T25 — Restore the central AI tutoring experience (2026-09-07)

Approved workflow: **Choose a topic → receive a problem → photograph your
solution → see the reading → receive specific guidance → revise or discuss
→ get the next appropriate problem.** No required school level or finite subject
catalog. Math, writing, reading, history, social studies, science, and other
topics use the same tutoring workflow. A model's limitations must be disclosed,
not turned into a hard-coded curriculum restriction.

The maintainer clarified that uploaded/pasted assignments are reference-only:
teach their concepts and generate distinct analogous practice, never solve the
original homework. The tutor guides and explains with different examples rather
than supplying the active task's answer. Tutor initiative is adjustable. Display
the full reading of handwritten work and actionable organization advice; clear
readings continue automatically, while uncertain/unreadable work
stops tutoring and asks for a cleaner or clarified submission. D009 supersedes
the old fixed-catalog and universal manual-confirmation product assumptions.

Contracts to implement: typed tutoring session/activity/settings endpoints;
generation, reading-quality and guidance provider schemas; existing durable
worker extended for context-aware generation and review; ownership-bound reading
quality routing without any approval endpoint; real database migration; primary multi-subject React workspace and
generated OpenAPI/TypeScript. Reuse private image normalization, iPhone QR upload,
provider routing, retention/export, retries and authentication. No fixed-template
catalog, authored-hint fallback, or manual/hidden approval gate in the tutor.
Historical math-domain test utilities do not constrain the learning experience.
No new service, model download, or paid hosting is required.

Acceptance: a non-math topic through generated activity, photograph, displayed
reading, guidance, revision/discussion, and next activity; pasted/photo reference
to distinct practice without original answers; low-quality photo stops before
guidance and gives handwriting advice; setting changes affect subsequent model
requests; bounded relevant history; duplicate/stale/wrong-owner/canceled/deleted
work cannot trigger extra accepted results. Check no hidden answer/provider
secret exposure, no local-to-cloud fallback, safe output rendering, migration
rollback/integrity, and content retention. Synthetic model responses establish
orchestration only, not actual accuracy or perfect resistance to answer leakage.

The maintainer explicitly reiterated that neither templates nor approvals were
ever desired; the proposed browser acknowledgement was also rejected. Persist the
reading and automatically continue clear work as a durable worker stage. Render
the reading before the feedback without waiting for a learner/client approval.

Plan and evidence protocol: follow `implement-task`; implement backend and UI in
separate owned files with an independent acceptance review, then run targeted
checks and `make check`, `make test-integration`, `make smoke`, `make eval-mock`.
Record exact observed outcomes here before completion. The maintainer authorized
committing the reviewed public T24/T25 changes and pushing `main`; private data,
unlicensed internet images, live inference, and public deployment remain outside
that authorization. Live vision/pedagogy and physical iPhone checks remain open.

Implementation:

- `api/tutoring.py`, `tutoring.py`, `worker.py`, shared practice/photo/phone routes,
  and provider contracts/transports now implement durable generation, full-work
  reading and contextual guidance. The primary AI path never calls the exact
  answer checker. Clear readings queue guidance automatically; uncertain readings
  terminate without tutoring and carry concrete organization/retake advice.
- Migration `0010_ai_tutoring.py` persists topic/mode/initiative with real SQLite
  constraints, structured reading observations, and tutor feedback. Models return
  neither verified grades nor completion commands. Moving on is an explicit
  learner action; subsequent generation receives relevant recent work and guidance.
- Source text/photo intake creates distinct practice. Original reference material
  is absent from subsequent guidance/adaptation prompts and is included in the
  authenticated adult export through an explicit typed reference list. Historical
  catalog/external-photo endpoints reject attempts to inject tasks into AI sessions.
- `Tutor.tsx` replaces the primary practice UI. Removed the obsolete `Practice.tsx`
  and `OfflinePractice.tsx` components and fixed-math profile controls. Kept
  authentication/provider/privacy controls, iPhone QR/crop/upload, and safe
  rendering. The AI interface has no catalog, required level, approval control,
  or authored fallback. Browser labels disclose separate text/photo processing.
- Regenerated OpenAPI and TypeScript; updated brand, setup/operations/provider
  instructions, AGENTS/SPECIFICATION/D009, threat model and acceptance criteria.
  `docs/TUTOR_EVALUATION.md` adds original cross-subject human-review cases. The
  earlier internet examples remain ignored, local-only and unlicensed for public
  redistribution. The container smoke assertion now matches the new UI title.

Observed verification (same explicit temporary toolchain environment recorded in
T24 below; async tests run outside the restricted sandbox using only synthetic
temporary data):

- `make contracts`: passed; generated files not hand-edited.
- `make check`: passed locks, Ruff/formatting, strict Python/TypeScript types
  (**54** Python source/test files), **125 backend unit tests**, **33 frontend
  component tests**, API/PWA builds, generated-contract drift, tracked credential
  scan and IaC lint. Backend unit runtime: **13.69 s**. Existing Vite chunk-size
  warning remains non-fatal (main JS approximately 504 kB; optional WebLLM bundle
  remains separate). No warning threshold was raised.
- Final root `make test-integration`: **128 passed in 35.96 s**, after the
  history-context and strict-test-typing corrections.
- Final targeted `pytest tests/integration/test_tutoring.py
tests/unit/test_tutoring_contracts.py`: **43 passed** in **7.12 s**, covering the
  **21** new AI integration and **22** new provider/quality/context contract cases.
- `make smoke`: **28 passed** across desktop/mobile Chromium in **3.2 min**,
  using the actual API, worker, SQLite and explicitly synthetic providers. A final
  `pnpm smoke --grep 'phone photo'` rerun passed **2** strengthened cases in **42 s**,
  asserting exact known-fixture reading, handwriting advice, reading-before-feedback
  DOM order, no approval call/control, phone privacy, revisions/discussion and a
  distinct next activity ID. No API success responses were invented by UI routes.
- `make eval-mock`: passed the existing **63 original rational/vision fixtures**
  with report `passed: true`; this is not a multi-subject model-quality score.
- `sh -n scripts/container-smoke.sh` and `git diff --check`: passed.

Review caught and fixed a photo-component remount losing lost-ack retry bytes, an
old external-problem endpoint bypass, and orphaned assistant context after history
trimming. Early full gates also caught new smoke/backend-test typing errors; they
were fixed without ignores, weakened assertions or disabled checks. Old browser
math/approval expectations were replaced because the maintainer explicitly
removed that product behavior; their privacy/retry/isolation assertions remain.

Not run: live vLLM/Spark/Ollama/Bedrock inference or quality evaluation, actual
iPhone Safari/camera/HTTPS/background testing, private operator setup, model
downloads, retained private-database migration, local container/security scan,
or public deployment. Synthetic confidence/policy fixtures do not prove actual
handwriting accuracy, teaching quality, factual correctness, or perfect resistance
to giving homework answers. Configure real tutor and vision routes and use
PHONE_SETUP/TUTOR_EVALUATION for the device/model trial.

Publication: the remote `origin/main` was fetched and matched the local base
before work was committed. The maintainer authorized a normal push to `main`;
no force push, deployment, private data, or unlicensed examples are included.
The final response records the resulting commit and remote/CI status.

### T24 — iPhone camera companion (2026-09-07)

Maintainer requested an end-to-end computer tutor with iPhone handwritten-photo
submission, using local vLLM or an explicitly configured API. One vertical slice:
an owner creates a five-minute upload permission for one assigned problem; an
unpaired phone captures/previews/uploads once; the computer's existing worker
and polling show an editable interpretation for confirmation before checking.

Contracts: new `phone_upload` migration and typed create/status/upload endpoints;
hashed bearer secret in the URL fragment and request header only; no phone access
to history, grading, provider credentials, or administration. Recheck origin,
issuing session, learner, assignment version and provider policy after decoding.
Identical upload retries acknowledge the same operation; changed payloads fail.
Expiry, replacement, logout/revocation, deletion and finished sessions invalidate
unused permissions. Public assets only remain cacheable.

Acceptance: migration/rollback and integrity; owner/anonymous/wrong-learner
authorization; expiry, replacement, revocation, stale assignments, duplicate and
lost-ack upload; one worker interpretation and explicit confirmation; two-browser
capture with photo preview, no sensitive caching, and phone-width layout.
Required gates: `make check`, `make test-integration`, `make smoke`,
`make eval-mock`. Real iPhone/Spark/vLLM evidence remains separate from fixtures.

Implementation and evidence (the repository `implement-task` workflow):

- Backend: `api/phone.py`, shared normalization/enqueue in `api/photos.py`,
  `api/app.py`/`api/limits.py`, `adapters/db/models.py`, migration
  `0009_phone_upload.py`, and retention sweep. A token is bound to its issuing
  session, problem/version and processing-policy fingerprint. No browser-session
  credential is delegated; previews are reauthorized after decoding; one atomic
  accepted upload creates one submission/job. Used links disclose only a receipt.
- Frontend: `PhoneLink.tsx`, `PhoneCapture.tsx`, `PhotoInput.tsx`, `Practice.tsx`,
  `client.ts`, `main.tsx`, and styles. Local SVG QR generation with pinned
  `qrcode.react` 4.2.0; fragment secret removed from the address bar and kept in
  memory; phone upload needs no sign-in; computer shows the submitted image
  beside the editable reading before confirmation. Regenerated
  `contracts/openapi.json` and `apps/web/src/generated/api.d.ts` using
  `make contracts`; no hand-edited generated client.
- Native launch: `make serve`/`scripts/dev.py --gateway` builds and supervises one
  loopback API and worker behind an operator-configured HTTPS gateway. README,
  RUNBOOK and PHONE_SETUP distinguish camera-only delegation from full learner
  pairing, and document all-LAN Caddy or private Tailscale Serve, explicit cloud
  consent, Spark/vLLM setup/probes, and current math limitations. No network
  service or paid hosting was provisioned.
- Image budget: documented adjustment from 24,000,000 to 25,000,000 decoded pixels
  accommodates a synthetic 5712 × 4284 (24 MP-class) photo; 8 MiB input and
  2048-pixel normalized bounds remain. Above-limit rejection remains tested.
  SPECIFICATION and THREAT_MODEL match the implementation.
- Maintainer's six root internet images moved unaltered into ignored
  `evals/incoming/internet-examples/`. `evals/incoming/README.md` records visual
  suitability and missing provenance/ground truth; MANIFEST excludes them from
  public fixtures. A local `normalize` check accepted the three PNG/JPEG examples
  and rejected the three GIFs. An original in-memory GIF now covers valid-GIF
  rejection in CI without redistributing the downloads. No provider evaluation
  or learner submission used these examples.

Actual commands and outcomes:

- `make check`: passed locked dependencies, lint/format, Python/TypeScript types,
  **103 backend unit tests**, **23 frontend tests**, API/PWA builds, regenerated
  contract drift, tracked-public-text secret scan, and existing infrastructure
  lint. New launcher tests assert HTTPS-mode validation, loopback binding, API +
  worker supervision and cleanup using mocked subprocesses. Vite still emits a
  non-failing large-chunk warning; no bundle-size gate was relaxed.
- `make test-integration`: **107 passed**, including all 15 phone scenarios and
  real SQLite migration/rollback/metadata checks. Phone cases cover hash-only
  persistence, creation-ack replay, concurrent identical uploads, changed bytes,
  single worker operation, no grading before explicit confirmation, wrong
  learner/anonymous/origin/body rejection, expiry/replacement/logout/deletion/
  cancellation/stale assignment, and authorization/policy changes during decode.
- `make smoke`: **24 passed** across desktop and mobile Chromium configurations.
  The new case uses two independent browser contexts, previews/sends a synthetic
  image without phone login, checks no secret in request URLs or local storage,
  no external request, phone-width layout, computer confirmation before grading,
  one operation, and a receipt on rescan. Existing lost-ack/reconnect/offline
  browser regressions also passed. Chromium emulation is not iPhone Safari proof.
- `make eval-mock`: passed **63 original rational/vision fixtures**; report
  `evals/reports/deterministic.json` has overall `passed: true`. This is a workflow
  and deterministic-evaluation check, not measured handwriting accuracy.
- `git diff --check`: passed. An additional `rg -l` credential-pattern scan of
  the eight new public source/docs files found no matches (exit 1). `git
check-ignore` confirms all six moved internet images are excluded.

Verification environment: existing checkout was clean initially. Its API venv
had a broken interpreter reference and this shell lacked Node/pnpm. Tests used
temporary tools without replacing the checkout's venv: Python **3.14.7**, uv
**0.12.10**, Node **24.20.0**, pnpm **12.3.4**. Commands above used:

```bash
export PATH=/tmp/math-tutor-toolchain-GanGTg/node-v24.20.0-linux-x64/bin:/tmp/math-tutor-toolchain-GanGTg/pnpm/node_modules/.bin:$PATH
export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/tmp/math-tutor-venv
export UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR=/tmp/math-tutor-python
export UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/math-tutor-uv-cache
export PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/opt/google/chrome/chrome
```

These temporary paths describe this run, not portable setup requirements. Node's
archive hash was verified against its official SHASUMS. Dependency downloads were
approved; no model weights were downloaded. The sandbox stalled even a minimal
AnyIO thread test, so async/backend/browser checks ran with approved execution
outside it. One approval-review timeout occurred before command execution; the
permitted retry succeeded. Initial lint/type/mock-response issues and stale
database-inventory assertions were corrected; the final gates above passed
without weakened assertions.

Not run: live Meta/Spark/vLLM probes or handwriting-quality evaluations, real
iPhone QR/Safari/HEIC/background/accessibility checks, HTTPS gateway installation,
private account/provider configuration, retained-data migration, container/hosted
CI or security-release scans. No private operator files were opened, no paid
inference or cloud provisioning occurred, and nothing was committed/pushed.
Next bounded maintainer action: follow PHONE_SETUP on the chosen host, configure
the private HTTPS origin and exact image-capable provider, explicitly authorize
its synthetic vision probe, then photograph one original fraction/equation and
compare the reading before confirming. API compatibility does not establish
exact-model image/structured-output support or transcription quality.

## Evidence

Entries below are historical observations. The final SQLite decision entry and
D004 supersede earlier PostgreSQL prerequisites; the initial push authorization
supersedes the earlier push deferral. Historical checks are not database evidence.

### 2026-09-06 — Python/uv backend foundation

- `make bootstrap`: passed using Python 3.13.15 and the committed lockfile.
- `make check`: passed lock freshness, Ruff lint/format, strict mypy, one pytest API
  test, and both sdist and wheel builds.
- Uvicorn smoke test: `GET /health` returned HTTP 200 with `{"status":"ok"}`;
  the temporary localhost server then shut down cleanly.
- Repository skill validation: passed for
  `.agents/skills/implement-task/SKILL.md`.
- Not run: frontend or CI checks; those parts of T00 do not exist yet.

### 2026-09-06 — Review of implemented bootstrap and commit safeguards

Scope: close gaps in the existing backend/development workflow. No T01–T23
features were started, and no application behavior or acceptance gate was relaxed.

Findings and changes:

- Replaced the long blueprint README with current status, tested setup, implemented
  commands, contributor guidance, limitations, and the next bounded task. Preserved
  normative requirements in `docs/SPECIFICATION.md`; roadmap and A01–A24 table rows
  are unchanged. Updated `AGENTS.md` and this task log to point to that authority.
- Added `.pre-commit-config.yaml` using locked `pre-commit` and `pre-commit-hooks`
  development dependencies in `apps/api/pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock`. Added
  `hooks-install`, `hooks-check`, and `pre-commit-check` to `Makefile`.
- Installed the Git pre-commit hook in this checkout. It rejects private paths,
  private key material, merge markers, files over 1 MiB, malformed YAML/TOML, and
  whitespace problems, then runs backend lock/lint/format/type/test checks.
  Added root `secrets/` and `logs/` exclusions to `.gitignore`.
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for the existing backend with locked setup,
  hooks, and package checks, read-only permissions, a job timeout, and verified
  action commit pins. Recorded tooling resolutions/pins in `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`.

Actual verification:

- `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/math-tutor-uv-cache make bootstrap`: passed with Python
  3.13.15 and uv 0.12.10; lock resolves 42 packages.
- `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/math-tutor-uv-cache make check`: passed lock freshness, Ruff
  lint/format, strict mypy (4 files), pytest (1 API test), and sdist/wheel builds.
- `uv run --project apps/api --locked pre-commit validate-config
.pre-commit-config.yaml`: passed (with the writable cache override).
- `make hooks-install`: passed in this checkout and in the temporary fixture.
- In a temporary Git repository containing only reviewed public files, fresh
  `make bootstrap`, `make hooks-install`, `make hooks-check`, `make check`, and an
  initial synthetic commit all passed. Bootstrap used the already installed
  Python 3.13.15 interpreter explicitly via `UV_PYTHON`; dependencies were installed
  into a new virtual environment. Subsequent hook checks ran with `UV_OFFLINE=true`.
- `python3 /tmp/math-tutor-verify-hooks.py`: passed 12 rejected-commit scenarios:
  synthetic `.env`, provider config, upload, private-key marker, merge marker,
  oversized file, malformed YAML, malformed TOML, whitespace, staged invalid Python
  with an unstaged fix, source deletion, and stale lock metadata. The staged/unstaged
  test verified both versions were preserved. Public `.env.example` and
  `providers.example.yaml` committed successfully. These were disposable fixture
  commits; the working repository's index was not changed.
- Local Markdown link/heading validation passed for README, AGENTS, and all three
  docs files. The moved roadmap and acceptance rows were compared with the original
  README and preserved verbatim.
- Environment limitations encountered and resolved: the default uv cache is
  read-only here, so checks used a writable `/tmp` cache. A first offline fresh
  install lacked interpreter discovery and cached packages; the successful fresh
  install explicitly selected the existing interpreter and downloaded locked
  packages. This is not evidence of a fresh Python runtime download.

Readiness and remaining gates:

- The existing backend scaffold and local commit workflow pass their checks.
  **T00 remains in progress.** Finish the React/Vite scaffold, a rendered page,
  one frontend test, and frontend type/lint/build gates in Make and CI. Record a
  hosted CI run after an authorized push before claiming T00 complete.
- After T00, proceed in dependency order through T01–T05 to one persisted fraction
  problem with typed input and deterministic feedback. Provider work comes later.
- Not run: GitHub-hosted CI, frontend/database/integration/end-to-end checks, full
  API-token secret scanning, dependency vulnerability scanning, or any live
  provider/model evaluation. Hosted CI needs a push; the other infrastructure and
  gates are not implemented. Private-key/path checks do not replace broader scans.
- License confirmation and a complete license file remain required before public
  release. No deployment, Git push, model download, or real-data test was performed.
- The repository still has no initial commit; existing public files remain
  untracked and were preserved. Selectively review and stage them before using
  `make hooks-check` on this checkout (it enumerates tracked files).

### 2026-09-06 — Local T00 completion and T01–T05 handoff

The maintainer authorized completing the local foundation and explicitly deferred
pushing/hosted CI evidence. They also requested latest LTS tooling. D001 and D002
in `docs/DECISIONS.md` record the updated baseline and local completion rule; the
historical evidence above remains unchanged.

Changes and contracts satisfied:

- Added `apps/web/` with React/TypeScript/Vite, Tailwind, an honest development
  preview, semantic structure, a JavaScript-disabled fallback, and a component test.
  No practice, authentication, database, or provider feature is claimed.
- Added root pnpm workspace/configuration, exact direct versions, `pnpm-lock.yaml`,
  `.node-version`, strict TypeScript/type-aware ESLint, and Prettier. Added
  `scripts/check-toolchain.mjs` with actionable runtime/package-manager failures.
- Updated `.python-version`, `apps/api/pyproject.toml`, and `uv.lock` for Python
  3.14.7. Current upstream releases were checked online. Node 24.20.0 is latest LTS;
  Python uses its stable support lifecycle. TypeScript 6.0.3, Vitest 4.1.11, and the
  generally available Ubuntu CI runner have documented compatibility exceptions.
- Expanded `Makefile` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` so frontend locks, lint,
  formatting, types, and component tests are part of the normal gate. pnpm 12's
  multi-document lockfile has its own YAML check; other YAML still requires a
  single valid document. No file is excluded from lockfile syntax validation.
- Added `playwright.config.ts` and `tests/smoke/bootstrap.spec.ts`. `make smoke`
  builds the app, starts fresh loopback API/frontend servers, checks real API health
  and rendering at desktop/mobile sizes, rejects external page requests, checks
  overflow/page errors, and verifies the JavaScript-disabled fallback.
- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with pinned Node/pnpm setup, current verified
  action SHAs, both stacks' checks, and the browser smoke gate. Added nested API/web
  instructions and `docs/HANDOFF.md` with a copyable Spark prompt, task boundaries,
  database prerequisites, and commands for this environment. Updated README,
  specification, and dependency records to match.
- D003 explicitly resolves the T05/T06 sequencing ambiguity as a preparation
  assumption: immediate transactional checks in T05, durable queued processing in
  T06. Idempotency, ownership, stale-version handling, and immutable profile
  snapshots already apply in T05. The maintainer may still revise this assumption.

Actual commands and outcomes (using the writable paths in HANDOFF.md):

- `make bootstrap PNPM='pnpm --store-dir /tmp/math-tutor-pnpm-store'`: passed;
  Python 3.14.7, uv 0.12.10, Node 24.20.0, pnpm 12.3.4. Both locks installed.
  Node archive SHA-256 was checked against the official release manifest; Python
  was downloaded via uv. Runtime downloads were development tooling, not models.
- `make check PNPM='pnpm --store-dir /tmp/math-tutor-pnpm-store'`: passed both
  lock checks, Ruff, type-aware ESLint, Python/frontend formatting, strict mypy and
  TypeScript, 1 pytest API test, 1 Vitest component test, and Python/frontend builds.
- `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome make smoke`: passed
  all 4 tests using Chrome 152.0.7977.82. Desktop/mobile rendering and disabled-JS
  fallback each passed. Servers shut down after the tests. Mobile emulation is not
  a real-device certification.
- `python3 /tmp/math-tutor-verify-t00.py`: in a public-only temporary Git copy,
  fresh Python/frontend environments, `make bootstrap`, `make hooks-install`,
  `make hooks-check`, `make check`, `make smoke`, and an initial synthetic commit
  passed. The fresh install reused downloaded packages and the verified runtimes;
  it did not reuse the existing project's virtual environment or node_modules.
- The same temporary-copy script rejected bad staged TypeScript despite an
  unstaged correction (preserving both versions), a stale frontend lock, source
  deletion, a synthetic private `.env`, and an unsupported Node major. The fixture
  finished clean, and the original index remained untouched.
- Local Markdown link/heading checks and cross-file toolchain-pin checks passed.
  The original repository still has no staged files or initial commit.

Failures resolved during verification:

- Added DOM library types to the browser-test TypeScript configuration.
- Replaced Vitest 5 after reproducible declaration failures; strict checks stay
  enabled and pass on 4.1.11. Details are in D001.
- Local server startup initially failed with sandbox `EPERM`; the same tests
  passed with permission for loopback listeners, without broadening bind hosts.
- Playwright excludes `noscript` from its text matcher. The fallback now contains
  a paragraph; the test asserts that paragraph's visibility and exact text with
  JavaScript disabled. No assertion was removed.
- The generic YAML hook initially rejected pnpm 12's valid multi-document file;
  a dedicated multi-document syntax check now passes alongside frozen-lock checks.

Remaining boundaries:

- **Ready for T01 code work.** This environment has no Docker/Compose/PostgreSQL
  server or client. Establish a real disposable PostgreSQL runtime in T01, then run
  migrations and integration tests. Do not skip these or substitute SQLite.
- T01–T05 implementation remains unstarted. Generated API types are required when
  the first frontend API consumer is implemented; this static preview has none.
- Not run: hosted GitHub CI (maintainer deferred), PostgreSQL integration tests,
  full dependency vulnerability/API-token scans, real-phone testing, or live
  provider evaluations. Those are not represented as passing. No push, deployment,
  cloud provisioning, model download, or real learner data was used.
- Public-release license selection remains pending and does not block local T01.

### 2026-09-06 — Approved SQLite plan and initial publication preparation

The maintainer approved updating the plans to SQLite and explicitly authorized
the initial commit and push of the reviewed repository to `main`. D004 supersedes
the PostgreSQL runtime requirement above. This increment updates the persistence
contract and commit safeguards; it does not implement T01.

Changed files and requirements:

- `docs/DECISIONS.md`: recorded D004, including one-host operation, local storage,
  WAL/foreign keys/lock waits/durability, transaction control, typed persistence,
  migrations, worker claims, backups, and future scaling criteria. Updated D002
  to distinguish initial publication authorization from later task pushes.
- `docs/SPECIFICATION.md`: aligned architecture, configuration, data model,
  integration gates, planned Make commands, T01/T20, local packaging, and AWS
  hosting with SQLite. Replaced PostgreSQL-specific locking and Fargate/RDS with
  the single-host contract. All A01–A24 acceptance rows are preserved.
- `README.md`, root/API `AGENTS.md`, and `docs/HANDOFF.md`: made the supported
  database and T01–T05 instructions consistent. Native T01 no longer needs Docker
  or a database daemon. Later implementation remains one task at a time.
- `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`: recorded current stable SQLite 3.53.4 from the official
  release history and the actual Python runtime's 3.53.1 library. T01 must resolve
  that runtime gap, verify the embedded version, and add real integration gates.
- `.gitignore` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: exclude/block database files and
  WAL/SHM/journal sidecars in any directory. Synthetic test databases are generated
  from source fixtures. This task log records the actual preparation evidence.

Actual verification (using the temporary tool/cache paths in HANDOFF.md):

- `make check PNPM='pnpm --store-dir /tmp/math-tutor-pnpm-store'`: passed both
  lock checks, Python/frontend lint/format/type checks, 1 pytest and 1 Vitest test,
  Python wheel/sdist builds, and the Vite build.
- `make smoke` with the documented Chrome executable and loopback permission:
  all 4 desktop/mobile browser tests passed; temporary servers shut down.
- `python3 /tmp/math-tutor-verify-sqlite-plan.py`: links/anchors passed in 9
  documents, all 45 specification footnotes resolved, and A01–A24 matched the
  pre-change public snapshot. A disposable Git fixture verified 12 database/
  sidecar names are ignored and rejected by the hook; 3 public fixture/document
  names remain allowed. Only synthetic files were used.
- `git ls-remote --heads origin`: succeeded with no branches returned before
  preparing the first commit. No existing remote history will be overwritten.
- `git diff --cached --check`: passed for the 41 reviewed public files staged
  for the initial commit. `make hooks-check`: all applicable hooks passed,
  including private-key/file hygiene and backend/frontend project checks.
  The first sandboxed run could not open the tracked skill file in read/write
  mode for newline checks; the complete run passed with filesystem permission.
  No check was skipped or weakened to work around the restriction.

T00 remains complete locally and T01 is ready to start using HANDOFF.md. Database
migrations/integration tests, live provider evaluations, real-phone validation,
and release vulnerability scans are not run because their tasks remain unstarted.
Hosted CI requires observing a run after the authorized push; no result is claimed
here. No application deployment, cloud provisioning, or model download is included.

### 2026-09-06 — T01 SQLite foundation (local completion)

T01 implements the D004 persistence foundation with SQLAlchemy 2.0.52 and
Alembic 1.19.2 (locked with greenlet 3.5.5, Mako 1.4.1, MarkupSafe 3.0.3).
No second database engine was introduced.

Changed files and requirements:

- `apps/api/src/math_tutor/settings.py`: one absolute file-backed SQLite path
  from `DATABASE_URL` (default `./data/math_tutor.sqlite3`); non-SQLite schemes
  and `:memory:` are rejected. Embedded-version floor `MIN_SQLITE_VERSION`.
- `apps/api/src/math_tutor/adapters/db/`: engine factory applying
  WAL/foreign-keys/busy-timeout-5000/synchronous-FULL on every connection with
  read-back verification; UUID-as-text and aware-UTC (naive rejected) column
  types; declarative base with a stable naming convention; `PracticeSession`
  and `ProblemInstance` models (FK, status/range checks, per-session position
  uniqueness). `PracticeSession.learner_id` gains its learner FK in T03.
- `apps/api/src/math_tutor/api/schemas.py`: public session/problem schemas
  excluding the hidden expected answer, raw parameters, seed, and ownership
  identifiers.
- `apps/api/src/math_tutor/cli.py` + `make db`: prepare/secure the data
  directory, enforce the SQLite floor, and verify effective PRAGMAs. No daemon,
  no implicit migration.
- `apps/api/alembic.ini` + `apps/api/migrations/`: env wired to app settings
  with batch rendering; migration `0001_practice_tables` with named
  constraints and a downgrade. `make migrate` stops-note included.
- `apps/api/tests/unit/test_public_schemas.py`: hidden-answer, parameter,
  seed, and ownership exclusion tests.
- `apps/api/tests/integration/test_db_foundation.py`: 16 on-disk tests using
  temporary files with production settings — empty-file upgrade to head,
  migration/metadata drift check, per-connection PRAGMA verification,
  FK/check/unique enforcement, transactional rollback, downgrade/re-upgrade,
  reopen persistence, UTC naive-rejection/normalization, UUID round
  trip/rejection, settings resolution/rejection, version floor, CLI `db`
  success/failure, and hidden-answer retention with public exclusion.
- `Makefile`: real `db`, `migrate`, and `test-integration` targets; backend
  `test` now runs `tests/unit` only. `.env.example`: database settings without
  secrets. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `make db` runtime/settings check and
  `make test-integration` gate, no database service.
- SQLite runtime decision: the official release history still lists 3.53.4
  (2026-07-24) as current stable, and Python 3.14.7 (2026-08-05, the latest
  3.14 patch) loads 3.53.1; no reproducible newer runtime exists. The
  3.53.2–3.53.4 deltas are follow-up fixes for 3.53.0 regressions, and T01
  uses only long-stable surface covered by the integration suite. Recorded as
  a compatibility exception under D001 with floor 3.53.1, recheck on the next
  tooling update. A standalone SQLite CLI was not substituted.

Actual verification (with `UV_CACHE_DIR`/`UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` overrides and
a SHA-256-verified Node 24.20.0 provisioned under `/tmp`):

- `python -m pytest tests/unit tests/integration`: 19 passed (3 unit, 16
  integration) on Python 3.14.7 / SQLite 3.53.1.
- `python -m ruff check .`, `ruff format --check .`, `python -m mypy src
tests` (strict): all pass. `uv lock --check`: 47 packages. `uv build`:
  sdist/wheel pass.
- Frontend (untouched, re-verified): ESLint, Prettier check, root and web
  `tsc --noEmit`, Vitest (1 passed), Vite build — all pass.
- `make db` through make against a temp `DATABASE_URL`: prints the absolute
  path, `sqlite: 3.53.1 (floor 3.53.1)`, and all four effective PRAGMAs.
  Alembic `upgrade head` from empty file succeeds; `make migrate`'s config
  path was fixed after it failed to resolve the ini location.
- Findings fixed, none waived: symbolic-vs-numeric `synchronous` read-back,
  a dict-vs-set test assertion, and mypy variance on the UUID adapter.

Not run: `make check`/`make smoke` wrappers and hosted CI. This sandbox
denies executing workspace binaries (`Operation not permitted`), so bare
console-script Make targets cannot spawn here; every underlying gate was run
via `python -m`/`node` directly instead. Chrome SIGTRAPs on `socketpair`,
so no browser process can launch in this session. The smoke-covered paths
(`GET /health`, static preview) are untouched and the Vite output hashes are
unchanged. CI runs the real wrappers after push; no hosted result is claimed.

Next bounded task: T02 adult bootstrap/login per HANDOFF.md. No push beyond
the authorized one; later task pushes need their own authorization.

### 2026-09-06 — T02 adult bootstrap/login (local completion)

T02 implements the SPEC section 12 authentication slice for the adult
administrator: Argon2id password hashes, opaque server sessions, login/logout
with CSRF and expiry, an interactive bootstrap CLI, and placeholder-secret
rejection. Learner pairing/ownership stays in T03; no provider, job, or
frontend-login work is claimed.

Changed files and requirements:

- `apps/api/pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`: added `argon2-cffi>=25.1,<26`
  (resolved 25.1.0 with bindings 26.1.0, cffi 2.1.1, pycparser 3.0; 51
  packages). The hasher's default output was verified to be `$argon2id$`.
- `apps/api/src/math_tutor/settings.py`: `SESSION_SECRET` (missing,
  placeholder, or under 32 characters raises; the liveness probe stays
  exempt) and `APP_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` (default `http://localhost:8080`, selects
  the Secure cookie flag and accepted Origin).
- `apps/api/src/math_tutor/adapters/db/models.py` + migration
  `0002_auth_sessions`: `administrator` (unique login name, Argon2id PHC
  hash) and `device_session` (unique SHA-256 token hash, role, adult FK,
  plain `learner_id` until T03 adds its FK, per-session CSRF token,
  expiry, revocation). Downgrade drops both tables.
- `apps/api/src/math_tutor/auth.py`: 24-hour session lifetime, HMAC-signed
  anonymous CSRF bootstrap, salted password hashing, and 10 login
  attempts per minute per client address (over-budget attempts extend the
  wait; `Retry-After` is returned). Task-level parameters, not D-decisions:
  24 h lifetime, 10/min/IP limit, 12-character admin minimum.
- `apps/api/src/math_tutor/api/auth.py` + `api/app.py`: `GET
/api/v1/auth/session` (minimal status plus CSRF bootstrap, no learner
  list), `POST /api/v1/auth/login` (double-submit CSRF + Origin + rate
  limit, one identical 401 for unknown/wrong credentials), `POST
/api/v1/auth/logout` (session-bound CSRF, immediate revocation, cookie
  cleared). Session cookies are `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` on
  https origins, `Path=/`. Responses carry no password/token hashes.
- `apps/api/src/math_tutor/cli.py` + `Makefile` + `.env.example`: real
  `make admin` that prompts for the login name and reads the password twice
  via `getpass` (no `--password` flag, nothing in history/logs), creates or
  resets the administrator with a 12-character minimum, rejects a
  placeholder secret before prompting, and points at `make migrate` when
  tables are missing.
- Tests: 8 unit (`tests/unit/test_auth_secrets.py`: secret accept/reject,
  origin default/override, Argon2id format/verify/salts, anon-CSRF
  round-trip/rejection, token hashing, rate-limit counting) and 18
  integration (`tests/integration/test_auth_sessions.py`: empty-file
  migration with constraint checks, login-name uniqueness, password policy
  and reset, placeholder-secret 500s, cookie flags incl. Secure-on-https,
  response-shape leak checks, shared 401s, CSRF double-submit/forgery,
  Origin rejection, logout CSRF/revocation scoping to the presenting
  session, expired/tampered rejection, HTTP 429 with `Retry-After`, and five
  CLI paths). `test_db_foundation.py` now targets head `0002` with the four
  tables; its drift test covers the new models unchanged.

Actual verification (backend via the venv interpreter directly; the sandbox
denies spawning workspace console scripts, so bare `make` targets were not
used — every underlying gate ran explicitly):

- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit tests/integration`: 45 passed
  (11 unit, 34 integration) on Python 3.14.7 / SQLite 3.53.1.
- `.venv/bin/python -m ruff check .`, `ruff format --check .`,
  `.venv/bin/python -m mypy src tests` (strict, 19 files): all pass.
- `uv lock --directory apps/api --check`: fresh (51 packages). `uv build
--directory apps/api`: sdist/wheel pass.
- Frontend (untouched, re-verified with the provisioned Node 24.20.0):
  ESLint, Prettier check, root and web `tsc --noEmit`, Vitest (1 passed),
  Vite build — all pass. pnpm itself is unavailable in this shell, so the
  exact underlying binaries ran via `node ...` instead of `pnpm` scripts.
- `DATABASE_URL=<tmp> .venv/bin/python -m math_tutor.cli db`: prints the
  absolute path, `sqlite: 3.53.1 (floor 3.53.1)`, and all four PRAGMAs.
- `alembic -c alembic.ini upgrade head` against a temp `DATABASE_URL`:
  succeeds with all four tables plus `alembic_version`.
- Findings fixed, none waived: Pydantic `None` fields excluded from auth
  payloads, detached-instance read moved inside the CLI session, lowercase
  `SameSite=lax` assertion, https base URL for the Secure-cookie test
  (Secure cookies only return over https, matching browsers), and a missing
  settings fixture in the unmigrated-DB CLI test.

Not run: `make check`/`make smoke` wrappers and hosted CI. Chrome SIGTRAPs
in this sandbox so no browser process can launch; the smoke-covered paths
(`GET /health`, static preview) are untouched and the Vite output rebuilds
cleanly. CI runs the real wrappers after push; no hosted result is claimed.

Next bounded task: T03 learners, device pairing, and ownership boundaries
per HANDOFF.md. The maintainer authorized this task's push to `main`.

### 2026-09-06 — Independent T01/T02 review and gap closure

The maintainer requested review of Spark 1.3's T01/T02 work, fixes, a push to
`main`, a model assessment, and a T03 readiness decision. The starting tree was
clean at `17308bb`; Spark's T01 commit was `bf54cc9`. Review addressed T01 first,
then T02, without implementing T03. This request authorizes the review push.

Original hosted evidence was independently observed with `gh run list`:

- [T00: passed](https://github.com/tylermowll/shepherd-academy-universe/actions/runs/34046875874).
- [T01: passed](https://github.com/tylermowll/shepherd-academy-universe/actions/runs/34067432542).
- [T02: passed](https://github.com/tylermowll/shepherd-academy-universe/actions/runs/34071452670).

Findings and fixes, ordered by consequence:

- **High, T01 — transaction guarantees were absent.** The engine retained
  sqlite3's legacy transaction mode despite comments claiming explicit control.
  A created table survived rollback and a read changed within its transaction.
  `adapters/db/engine.py` now disables implicit BEGIN and lets SQLAlchemy issue
  BEGIN; `migrations/env.py` explicitly enables transactional DDL and disposes
  engines. New tests cover DDL/savepoint rollback, stable read snapshots, and a
  deliberately failing migration preserving both schema and data. This follows
  the [SQLAlchemy transaction documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/dialects/sqlite.html#enabling-non-legacy-sqlite-transactional-modes-with-the-sqlite3-or-aiosqlite-driver).
- **High, T01 — path validation was disconnected from actual connections.**
  Default paths changed with cwd, engines used relative URLs directly, and
  rejected in-memory configurations still reached the engine factory. Settings
  and every engine now resolve the same absolute file, enforce the runtime
  floor and file-only configuration, and prepare mode-0700 storage with mode-0600
  database/sidecars. SQL parameter values are hidden in database exceptions.
- **High, T02 — Origin/Host and startup contracts were incomplete.** A matching
  attacker-controlled Host was trusted, scheme differences were accepted, CSRF
  bootstrap did not check Origin, non-loopback HTTP could issue insecure cookies,
  and missing secrets did not stop startup. The API now validates startup
  configuration and configured Host/full Origin, requires HTTPS off loopback,
  rejects whitespace-only secrets, and prevents caching of API responses.
  Native dev/smoke servers disable forwarded headers. Checks use the configured
  target origin, consistent with the [OWASP CSRF guidance](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#checking-the-origin-header).
- **Medium, T02 — authentication lifecycle gaps.** Anonymous CSRF expiry was
  only a browser cookie lifetime; signed tokens now carry a server-checked time.
  Password resets now revoke existing sessions, and reauthentication rotates
  tokens/CSRF while revoking the old session. Login rechecks credentials in a
  short write transaction so a concurrent reset cannot create a valid session.
  Lock contention returns a bounded `503`/`Retry-After` without partial writes.
- **Medium, T02 — credential and limiter edge cases.** Bootstrap accepted
  passwords the API rejected (>256 characters), unknown users skipped password
  hashing, and the in-process limiter had unsynchronized/unbounded state. Bounds
  now agree, unknown users perform Argon2id verification, and the one-process
  limiter has atomic admission, fixed windows, and a capped key count. Validation
  errors do not echo credential inputs; CLI errors do not print SQL parameters,
  and password entry refuses a terminal fallback that would echo the password.
- **Medium, T02 — unconstrained session identity.** New migration
  `0003_session_invariants.py` adds role/principal and expiration checks using
  Alembic batch operations. Valid rows survive; invalid legacy rows stop and
  roll back the migration without deletion. Named constraints and foreign keys
  are verified. Migrations 0001 and 0002 were preserved.
- **Setup and evidence gaps.** `cli.py`, `Makefile`, `.env.example`, and README
  now provide `make setup` and explicit environment export instructions; the
  old advice to copy `.env` alone did not load settings. Setup generates a random
  secret and absolute URL, creates a private file exclusively, and never reads
  or overwrites an existing one. `playwright.config.ts` supplies isolated
  synthetic settings for startup; CI's `make db` uses a temporary path.
  Database tests now hold two independent connections concurrently (the old
  test reused one pooled connection) and compare all four tables and their
  constraints, including failed-migration/data-preservation cases. The UTC
  adapter also rejects tzinfo objects that supply no offset.

Actual verification:

- Before fixes, added T01 regressions produced **7 failures / 16 passes**;
  added T02 checks reproduced **5 failures** for startup, Origin, reset,
  cache headers, and password bounds. The first HTTP expiry test exercised
  browser cookie expiration; it was corrected to replay a captured cookie and
  complemented by direct server-token expiry/future-time tests.
- After T01 fixes: `make check PNPM='pnpm --store-dir
/tmp/math-tutor-pnpm-store'` passed, and `make test-integration` passed
  **42 tests** before the T02 review changes.
- After all fixes: `apps/api/.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/api/tests/unit
apps/api/tests/integration -q` passed **85 tests**, up from 45 original cases.
  This is 22 unit tests and 63 on-disk integration tests; all data is synthetic.
- Final `make check PNPM='pnpm --store-dir /tmp/math-tutor-pnpm-store'` passed
  both locks, lint/format, strict mypy (19 files), TypeScript, 22 pytest unit
  tests, 1 Vitest test, wheel/sdist, and Vite builds. Its first run caught seven
  strict mypy import errors in new tests; those were fixed without suppressions.
- `make test-integration`: **63 passed**. Coverage includes concurrent reset
  during login, replay/revocation, untrusted Origin/Host, concurrent limiter
  admission, a real five-second SQLite lock wait/retry, and migration rollback.
- `make smoke`: **4 passed** (desktop/mobile Chromium, including the
  JavaScript-disabled fallback). Temporary servers shut down after the tests.
- `make db` and `make migrate` against an exclusively generated `/tmp` database:
  SQLite **3.53.1**, WAL, foreign keys **1**, busy timeout **5000**, synchronous
  **FULL**; empty-file upgrade through **0003** succeeded. The temporary files
  were removed afterward.
- Commands used the documented `/tmp` Node/Python/cache overrides. A sandboxed
  ASGI run stalled and was interrupted; the synthetic integration/browser gates
  passed with execution permission. No test policy was disabled. `git diff
--check` and `git diff --cached --check` passed. `make hooks-check` passed all
  applicable file/privacy, lock, lint/format/type, and unit/component checks.
  Commit `ae3f135` was pushed to `main`; [its full hosted CI run passed](https://github.com/tylermowll/shepherd-academy-universe/actions/runs/34072697983)
  in 1m31s, including locked installs, hooks, Make checks, SQLite runtime,
  integration, and browser smoke gates. A documentation follow-up records this
  observed result and warns existing installations to retain their absolute
  database URL when adopting the corrected default path.

Assessment of Spark's original work: **5/10 overall for these two tasks**, a
qualitative review judgment rather than a general model benchmark. It produced
useful, organized code, real migrations, separate public schemas, maintained
password hashing, locked dependencies, and passing CI. Its main weakness was
verifying the difficult contracts: tests covered ordinary paths while missing
transactions, trust boundaries, and lifecycle cases, and some comments/evidence
claimed guarantees the implementation did not provide. The fixes were
substantive. This sample supports using it for bounded implementation with
independent review, especially for persistence and authentication. No inference
speed, token use, or cost measurements were available for a throughput comparison.

**T03 is ready to start after this reviewed foundation.** Its bounded work is
managed aliases/eligibility, a real learner table plus ownership foreign keys,
single-use expiring pairing bound to the requesting browser, adult approval,
revocation, and two-learner read/mutation isolation with learner rejection from
adult routes. Generate API contracts if a frontend consumer is introduced.
T03 is not implemented by this review.

Not run: live/paid provider inference, model downloads, deployment, real learner
data, real-phone testing, or release vulnerability scans. These are outside
T01/T02; the SQLite compatibility exception remains D001. No runtime/private
configuration was opened, and no live database was migrated.

### 2026-09-06 — Maintainer-directed pre-production cutover

The maintainer clarified that nothing is in production and requested hard
cutovers without legacy bloat. D005 and `AGENTS.md` record that policy for future
work. This supersedes the preceding review's development-database upgrade plan;
the historical test/CI observations above remain observations of those commits.

- Folded session identity/lifetime constraints into migration
  `0002_auth_sessions.py` and deleted `0003_session_invariants.py`. There is one
  current schema and no bridge for previous development databases. README now
  directs users to recreate disposable development databases.
- Updated both integration suites to head 0002. Removed the two legacy-upgrade
  cases and added a current-schema test proving administrator authentication and
  opaque sessions survive an engine reopen. Kept empty-file migrations,
  constraints, foreign-key checks, DDL/savepoint rollback, failed-migration
  atomicity, expiry/revocation, ownership-principal checks, and secret exclusion.
- `make test-integration`: **62 passed**. `make check
PNPM='pnpm --store-dir /tmp/math-tutor-pnpm-store'`: all locks, lint/format,
  strict types, **22 unit + 1 frontend tests**, and Python/Vite builds passed.
  The current backend total is **84 tests**; the count change follows the removed
  compatibility behavior. No failing assertion was suppressed.
- `make db` and `make migrate` passed against a fresh, private `/tmp` database
  through the corrected head 0002; the generated database was removed afterward.
  `make hooks-check` and `git diff --cached --check` passed.
- The preceding documentation commit `99c5286` also passed its
  [hosted CI run](https://github.com/tylermowll/shepherd-academy-universe/actions/runs/34072857295).
  The cutover push/hosted CI are verified separately after this entry.

The assessment of Spark's original code remains **5/10 for T01/T02**. The removed
compatibility migration was added during this review, not by Spark. T03 remains
ready to start. No private database/configuration was opened or reset, and no
provider, deployment, or model-download work was performed.

### 2026-09-06 — Authorized completion of remaining implementation

The maintainer approved MIT, the remaining repository scope, end-batched checks,
hard cutovers and push to main. They deferred the items requiring physical devices
or provider accounts. D006 records the sequencing/schema decisions. The table
above distinguishes implementation from external acceptance; T19/T23 are not
claimed fully accepted without that evidence.

Affected contracts/files:

- `apps/api/migrations/versions/0001*` through `0008*`, ORM/domain/API/worker code:
  real learner ownership, pairing, exact skills, immutable profile/interpretation
  versions, durable work and call budgets, provider routes/probes, retention/audit.
- Provider transports/config and typed DTOs; generated `contracts/openapi.json`
  and `apps/web/src/generated/api.d.ts`, including separate work/final-answer fields.
- React practice/adult/photo/research components, safe math rendering, offline pack,
  service worker/update behavior and mobile/desktop workflows.
- Backup/restore and private S3 archive CLI, Docker/Compose/Caddy/CloudFormation,
  Make/CI checks, original eval fixtures and reports, MIT and operational docs.

Validation observed during implementation:

- `make check`: passed locks, Ruff lint/format, strict mypy (46 files), strict
  TypeScript, 60 backend unit tests, 3 frontend component tests, package/Vite
  builds, contract drift, tracked secret scan, and CloudFormation lint. Subsequent
  small capability/concurrency changes receive the final run recorded below.
- `make test-integration`: 80 passed, including four external-problem cases,
  migrations/rollback/ownership, provider recovery and encrypted restore.
- `pnpm smoke`: 12 passed on desktop/mobile Chromium before adding final pairing
  and disconnect coverage. Final full browser outcome is recorded below.
- `make eval-mock`: 33 exact rational cases and 30 mock-vision cases passed. This
  measures software orchestration, not model accuracy or handwriting quality.
- `make audit`: Python and pnpm reported no known vulnerabilities after updating
  cryptography from vulnerable 49.0.0 to fixed 50.0.1 (PYSEC-2026-3552).
- `make infra-check`: CloudFormation lint passed; no AWS resources were created.

Defects found and corrected by these checks included SQLite's unsupported direct
foreign-key alteration (changed to Alembic batch mode), a stale ORM test fixture,
restored WAL changes not reaching the copied database (explicit close/checkpoint),
a Vite worker module-format mismatch, a browser selector mismatch, and the
cryptography advisory. An initial browser invocation omitted this environment's
installed Chrome override; rerunning with the documented executable passed.
Checks were not weakened and no legacy compatibility bridge was added.

Not run: live Meta/Ollama/vLLM/compatible/Bedrock inference, account IAM validation,
model downloads, actual phone Safari/Chrome camera/install/background checks,
WebGPU model/device measurements, cloud provisioning or public deployment. The
maintainer checklist is in ACCEPTANCE. The original Spark T01/T02 assessment remains
5/10 for that observed work; these later implementations do not change its score.

Final local source validation: `make check` passed with **61 unit tests**, **3
component tests**, strict mypy/TypeScript, both builds and all contract/secret/IaC
checks. `make test-integration` passed **81 tests**, including simultaneous worker
claims. Both dependency audits passed and the 63-case synthetic evaluation passed.
`pnpm smoke` passed **14 desktop/mobile browser tests**, including disconnect after
submission, second-browser pairing/revocation, photo confirmation, offline cache,
and user-controlled updates. The disconnect test checks the actual server-failure
banner because browser online hints can remain true while requests are blocked.
`make hooks-check` and `git diff --check` passed on the reviewed staged files.
Visual review found an assistance-history display inconsistency; the final answer
turn now snapshots prior assistance, matching progress. Its focused workflow test
and captured browser scenario passed after the fix. The screenshot in
`docs/screenshots/synthetic-practice.png` contains only a generated synthetic alias
and exercise. It is presentation evidence, not a correctness test.

Docker is not installed in this workspace; the release container build, runtime
smoke and image scan are executed by hosted CI after the authorized push. A clean
checkout rehearsal and observed hosted result will be recorded separately.

Clean-clone rehearsal of implementation commit `9c81e37820dce43193d416bd427bd68a5bf93e29`:
`git clone --no-hardlinks` into a new `/tmp` checkout, `make bootstrap` with a
writable pnpm store, `make smoke` (**14 passed**) and `make test-integration`
(**81 passed**) all succeeded. Fresh virtualenv and node_modules were created;
the previously installed pinned Python runtime/package caches were reused.
The clone's tracked working tree remained clean. No operator settings were copied.
Hosted verification is [run 34078898044](https://github.com/tylermowll/shepherd-academy-universe/actions/runs/34078898044);
it passed source/unit/integration gates but failed two browser flows because an
older learner-list request could replace a newer list after creation. A focused
component regression reproduced the empty selection (one failure out of four),
and the adult panel now discards superseded refresh results. Original browser
assertions remain unchanged. The CI failure-context step now prints only synthetic
browser snapshots to make any further timing failures reviewable.

Follow-up recovery review applied the same response-order protection to session
selection/polling, with a second component regression. A subsequent browser run
exposed a logout `503` when a worker write invalidated its deferred read snapshot.
Logout now reserves its short write transaction before reading the session; an
on-disk competing-writer regression verifies this boundary. Authentication and
browser assertions were retained, with no retries or timeout relaxation.

The recovery fixes passed `make test-integration` (**82 tests**), `pnpm test`
(**5 component tests**), strict frontend types/lint, and `make smoke` (**14 browser
tests**). External-mode feedback now explicitly explains its missing trusted
answer key instead of suggesting a different numeric format. CI packaging runs
as a separate required job; no gate or failed assertion was disabled.

The same transaction-boundary review reproduced a stale photo assignment during
image decoding: the upload originally accepted version 1 after another connection
advanced it to version 2. Post-decode authorization now expires cached ORM state
inside the reacquired write transaction; the regression requires `409` and zero
submissions. Provider probes likewise refresh authorization state after I/O.

Hosted [run 34079742050](https://github.com/tylermowll/shepherd-academy-universe/actions/runs/34079742050)
passed the complete source job: 61 unit, 83 integration, 5 component and 14 browser
tests, generated contracts, synthetic evaluation and dependency audits. Its package
job built the image and passed non-root API/UI/worker/migration checks, then failed
the strict image scan on inherited OS/installer packages. D007 records the minimal
runtime correction. Public CI visibility and the checked-in synthetic-only job
were verified before reading scanner output; no private application logs were read.

Hosted [run 34080218959](https://github.com/tylermowll/shepherd-academy-universe/actions/runs/34080218959)
passed the complete package job: image build, non-root API/UI/worker readiness,
migrations, HEIF/cryptography runtime checks, strict HIGH/CRITICAL scan (including
unfixed findings), and SBOM generation. Its source job exposed three intermittent
browser failures in learner creation/pairing. An independent database reader at
the ASGI success-header boundary reproduced the cause: the default request-scoped
yield dependency committed after sending the response, allowing immediate browser
reads to see old state. The transaction dependency now uses FastAPI's function
scope, completing the commit before success. The new regression failed before
the fix and passed afterward. This complements the earlier stale-response guards;
no browser assertions, retries, timeouts, or scan severity were relaxed.

Final transaction fix validation: `make check` passed all source/build/contract/
secret/IaC gates with **61 backend unit tests** and **5 frontend component tests**;
`make test-integration` passed **84 tests**; `make smoke` passed **14 desktop/mobile
browser tests**. `git diff --check` passed. Hosted CI verifies the pushed revision
with its own fresh environment and the required packaging job.

### 2026-09-07 — Review and close workflow, privacy, and provider gaps

The maintainer authorized review, fixes, and a push to `main`. The earlier green
suite missed real failures in A08/A10/A22 and completed-photo retention; its result
did not establish that those paths were correct. This review uses synthetic
reproductions and adds regression coverage without relaxing specification gates.

Changes and affected contracts:

- T03/T05/T17, A22: learner selection clears the previous session hash, loaded
  sessions must match the selected learner, and stale/unmounted requests cannot
  restore old content. An authenticated 401 clears private UI immediately and
  bootstraps anonymous sign-in/pairing without requiring a page reload.
- T05/T06/T10, A08: pending mutations retain their original path, body/blob, and
  idempotency key after a lost acknowledgement. Recovery blocks conflicting
  actions and preserves the original request even if a later retry is throttled.
  Browser regressions simulate acceptance followed by a lost HTTP response.
- T10/T16: completion commits before deleting confirmed photos; image access
  returns 404 immediately. Cleanup retains durable references after storage
  failure, and sweeps retry completed objects regardless of age. Failed and
  unconfirmed photos retain the existing expiry limit. README now reflects the
  specification's immediate completed-photo rule, rather than only its TTL.
- T07/T09/T12–T14, A10: typed HTTP/Ollama/Bedrock response envelopes reject malformed
  nested values safely. The worker continues to the next job after bad output.
  Optional Bedrock cache metadata remains supported and consumed counters remain
  typed. DNS results are validated and pinned with original Host/TLS names;
  metadata targets are rejected before transmission.
- T06/T07: live calls have a total deadline covering process startup, DNS, SDK
  setup, and slow responses; timed-out local children are reaped. D008 documents
  the short-lived process boundary and the remaining remote billing limitation.
  Container smoke now checks subprocess execution without contacting a provider.
- T23: cancel, unmount, and withdrawn consent invalidate asynchronous browser
  model loading/evaluation. A late runtime import cannot start a worker/download;
  cache removal is serialized with loading. Tests mock the runtime and weights.

Validation:

- `make check PNPM='pnpm --store-dir /tmp/math-tutor-pnpm-store'`: passed locked
  dependencies, Ruff/ESLint/formatting, strict Python/TypeScript, **96 backend unit
  tests**, **19 component tests**, Python/UI builds, generated contract drift,
  tracked secret scanning, and IaC lint.
- `make test-integration`: **92 passed**, using temporary on-disk databases.
- `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome make smoke`:
  **22 passed** across desktop/mobile Chromium. Synthetic services shut down.
- `make eval-mock`: completed the **63 original rational/vision cases**.
- `git diff --check` and `sh -n scripts/container-smoke.sh`: passed. The final
  user-facing photo-retention wording was updated after smoke; it changes copy
  only. The required commit hook rechecks source/types/tests before publication.
- Focused regressions also verify worker progress after malformed output,
  total deadline under regularly arriving response chunks, API-thread spawning,
  Unicode payload transfer, and child expiry/reaping after its parent is killed.

During verification, a photo browser test's implicit-label selector did not resolve
the disabled purpose select; a semantic combobox locator fixed the test without
weakening its disabled-state or request-identity assertions. A second review of
the provider changes caught optional Bedrock cache metadata and dual-stack address
fallback regressions; both were corrected and covered before the final gates.

Hosted CI validates the pushed revision separately, including the restricted
container subprocess check, image scan, and SBOM. No application inference, model
download, provisioning, deployment, or access to private configuration/learner
data was performed. Live provider quality, real phones/accessibility, WebGPU
measurements, and private-host release acceptance still require the previously
deferred maintainer checks.
