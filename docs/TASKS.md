# Implementation tasks

This file owns the current work queue and completion evidence. The
[specification](SPECIFICATION.md) defines product requirements;
[implementation history](history/TASKS.md) preserves T00–T44 and the October 11
dependency refresh. Superseded workflows in that archive are historical evidence.
A task is complete only after its requirements and exit checks pass.

## Current checkpoint

The application is implemented through T44, with the October 11 dependency
refresh, T45 documentation consolidation and T46 legacy cleanup. The schema head
is `0020_request_recovery`. The last recorded private
deployment used runtime source `e9bf42c`, Python 3.15.0 and pillow-heif 1.8.1 on
**October 11, 2026**. Image, HTTPS, served-asset and authorization checks are in
the [release record](history/TASKS.md#release-publication-2026-10-11).
This is dated evidence; current provider selections and live teaching quality
have not been verified.

The maintainer subsequently refreshed `apps/api/uv.lock`. The October 17
publication checks below validate that unchanged lockfile for the authorized push
to `main`; October 11's deployment evidence still describes the older installation.

The remaining release work is in [ACCEPTANCE](ACCEPTANCE.md#items-requiring-the-maintainer).
T46 below records the maintainer-approved cleanup and publication checks. No
feature task is queued. Browser-model research and AWS hosting remain optional.

## T46 — Retire catalog-era workflows and redundant checks (2026-10-17)

**Status:** Complete; all local exit checks passed. The maintainer authorized
cleanup and publication to `main`, including the separately staged API lock refresh.

**Scope:** Remove catalog-only creation/profile/progress/photo-confirmation APIs,
authored answer delivery and the old worker/provider payload branches. Preserve
current tutor submissions, photos, automatic reading, recovery, ownership,
retention, historical record export and exact-math domain utilities. Remove
unreachable administrator tutoring controls, dead offline utilities/styles,
obsolete fixture metadata and repeated CI gates. Keep the explicitly optional
browser-model prototype and infrastructure tooling. No destructive schema change,
live inference, deployment or model download is authorized by this task.

**Contracts:** SPECIFICATION sections 1, 4, 9–13 and 16; D005/D009; generated
OpenAPI/TypeScript; current worker generation/reading/guidance payloads; learner
and administrator separation; retained-data export and migration integrity.

**Validation plan:** Update transport/execution tests to current payloads; retain
authorization, idempotency, worker recovery, photo ordering, retention and
on-disk migration coverage while removing tests for retired product behavior.
Add endpoint-removal/current-path regression checks. Run targeted checks, then
`make check`, `make test-integration`, mock evaluations, `make smoke-built`, dependency
audits and repository hooks. Regenerate contracts, inspect the complete staged
diff and record exact outcomes before committing and pushing `main`.

**Lockfile:** Preserve the maintainer's staged updates to filelock 4.2.1,
platformdirs 4.13.4 and virtualenv 21.14.10. Initial API lock SHA-256:
`6a5f6e9e79e4ca93e94e52abf9ec07b0e24eb6d8f916d8b570d04e57ae7d95d7`.
The API and isolated infrastructure locks remain beside their owning manifests;
this task does not introduce a Python workspace.

**Implementation:** Removed the catalog/profile/progress/skip/external-problem
and manual-confirmation routes, authored hint/answer helper and legacy provider
schemas/worker branches. Primary session settings now store difficulty alone;
current operations no longer query catalog evaluations. Historical sessions,
readings, feedback and verdicts remain exportable, with no hidden answer keys;
old queued jobs fail safely without provider calls. No table or migration changed.

Removed unreachable administrator controls and provider-refresh synchronization
from learner tutoring, the unused offline arithmetic helper and obsolete CSS.
Updated current learner guidance and security tests, generated OpenAPI and
TypeScript, and migrated evaluation diagnostics to current reading/feedback
schemas. Fixture images, holdout labels and historical reports are unchanged.
CI now runs repository hygiene plus one project gate, then tests the built app;
standalone hooks and smoke commands retain their complete behavior. D015 records
the runtime cutover, and DEPENDENCIES explains lockfile ownership.

**Validation (2026-10-17, before publication):**

Checks used checksum-verified Node 26.11.1 and registry-integrity-verified pnpm
12.11.2 under `/tmp/shepherd-cleanup-toolchain`, uv 0.13.1, application Python
3.15.0 / SQLite 3.53.1 and isolated infrastructure Python 3.14.8. A temporary
runner cleared operator/provider configuration variables, disabled env-file
loading and isolated tool caches. Tests requiring localhost sockets ran outside
the restricted sandbox against synthetic temporary data.

- `make bootstrap`: passed frozen JavaScript and locked Python installations.
- `make contracts`: regenerated OpenAPI and TypeScript. The initial attempt
  found an incomplete preinstalled generator; frozen bootstrap restored it.
- `make check`: passed locks, lint/format, Python/TypeScript types, builds,
  contracts, credential scan and IaC lint. **300 backend unit, 11 toolchain and
  187 component tests passed.** An earlier gate caught implicit test imports;
  those were corrected before the successful complete run.
- `make test-integration`: **346 passed in 57.69 seconds**, including the final
  positive feedback-publication assertions for competing workers/expired leases.
- `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome make smoke-built`:
  **80 desktop/mobile browser tests passed in 12.5 minutes**, with Chrome
  155.0.8059.84, zero retries and the production login rate limit unchanged.
- `make audit`: API Python, isolated infrastructure Python and pnpm reported
  **no known vulnerabilities**.
- All four mock evaluation CLI commands used the Makefile's fixtures and wrote
  `/tmp/shepherd-cleanup-*.json`: **33 exact cases and 30 vision fixtures** passed;
  reading and teaching passed **36 stages each**, adversarial teaching **20**.
  No historical report was rewritten.
- `make hooks-files-check` and `make hooks-check`: passed repository hygiene and
  the complete hook gate. The CI-only hygiene target skips the duplicate project
  hook because CI runs `make check` separately.
- `python3 /tmp/shepherd-cleanup-doccheck.py`: passed **202 local links/headings**
  across 22 Markdown files and every documented Make reference against **46
  targets**. Verified the historical task archive and all nine reports against HEAD.
  Revised Markdown formatting and `git diff --check` passed.
- Final staged credential/whitespace scans passed. Worktree and staged API lock
  hashes match the maintainer's original update above. A fetch confirmed the
  starting local `main` matched `origin/main` before publication.

All local publication gates passed. No live inference, model download,
private-data inspection, destructive migration or application
deployment was performed. Container packaging/scanning remains CI work for the
pushed revision; human/device/provider acceptance remains open.

## T45 — Documentation review and consolidation (2026-10-17)

**Status:** Complete; documentation checks passed. Release acceptance remains open.

**Scope:** Compare current documentation with public implementation, commands,
schemas and dependency manifests. Correct inaccurate claims, clarify setup and
operation, remove duplicate guidance and separate historical evidence from
current instructions. Preserve the maintainer's lockfile edit and dated model
reports. No runtime, public API, database or provider-policy changes.

**Documentation contracts:** README owns the overview and quick start; HANDOFF
routes ongoing work; SPECIFICATION owns requirements; RUNBOOK owns operations;
PHONE_SETUP owns phone access; PROVIDER_STATUS owns model configuration and
verification limits; TUTOR_EVALUATION owns evaluation procedures; ACCEPTANCE owns
remaining release checks; DEPENDENCIES owns dependency policy and exceptions;
DECISIONS owns architecture rationale. Historical task evidence lives separately.

**Exit checks:** Compare changed claims with source; check Markdown formatting,
local links and heading anchors, documented Make targets and whitespace. Inspect
the final diff for lost requirements, private material and unrelated changes.
Record actual outcomes below. Application and live-provider tests are not required
for documentation-only changes; earlier results remain dated evidence.

**Changes:** Updated README and the current guides listed above, THREAT_MODEL,
the evaluation manifest and its intake/Necklace guides. Moved dated task evidence
to `docs/history/TASKS.md`, preserving its text apart from relocated links.
Condensed superseded decision narratives while retaining every decision heading
and anchor. Removed duplicate deployment snapshots, package inventories and
task-specific copies of current requirements.

Source comparisons corrected the `compatible` adapter identifier, fixed
120-second job leases versus readiness heartbeats, file-managed provider reloads,
probe deadlines, operator-managed retention and backup cleanup, and prototype
features that the current app does not expose. The deployment and test records
remain explicitly dated; they do not validate later lockfile changes.

**Validation (2026-10-17):**

- `node_modules/.bin/prettier --check README.md docs/*.md docs/history/TASKS.md evals/MANIFEST.md evals/incoming/README.md evals/fixtures/the-necklace-README.md`:
  passed for all 16 revised Markdown files.
- `python3 /tmp/shepherd-doc-review/check_docs.py`: passed all 201 local
  links/heading references across 22 Markdown files, including the archive.
- `python3 /tmp/shepherd-doc-review/check_make_targets.py`: passed all 86 current
  documented target references against the 44 implemented Make targets.
- `git diff --check`: passed. Static comparisons confirmed archive preservation,
  all original decision headings/anchors, unchanged dated model reports and valid
  TOML in both Python locks. Independent cross-review found no material conflict
  among current guides, requirements and the inspected implementation.
- The maintainer's API lock SHA-256 remained
  `04617835b0f88cc37b5658d719134a02d7c829bd417a5e9917e5a0d6303fe02b`.

The initial documentation review used static checks only. Its subsequent
publication validation, including the maintainer's dependency update, is below.
The next operational action remains the model testing/selection in ACCEPTANCE.

### Publication checks (2026-10-17)

The maintainer authorized publishing the documentation and their API lock refresh
to `main`. The lock updates 22 packages, including Pillow 13.0.0, FastAPI 0.143.3
and SQLAlchemy 2.1.5; its original SHA-256 above is unchanged. A separately approved
internal wording cleanup fixes the skill's project name and replaces obsolete
T01–T05 navigation while retaining mandatory migration/integration gates.

Checks used checksum-verified Node 26.11.1 and integrity-verified pnpm 12.11.2 in
`/tmp/shepherd-publish-toolchain`, uv 0.13.1 and application Python 3.15.0. The
CloudFormation environment used isolated Python 3.14.8. `UV_NO_ENV_FILE=1` and
cleared operator/provider variables kept tests separate from private settings.

- `make check test-integration audit`: passed lock freshness, lint/format,
  Python/TypeScript types, builds, generated contracts, credential scan and IaC
  validation; **291 backend unit, 11 toolchain, 188 component and 340 integration
  tests passed**. Python application/infrastructure and pnpm audits reported no
  known vulnerabilities.
- The four mock evaluation CLI commands matched the Makefile's fixtures with
  outputs under `/tmp/shepherd-publish-*.json`. The deterministic report passed
  all 33 exact cases and 30 synthetic vision fixtures; reading and teaching
  passed 36 stages each, and adversarial teaching passed 20 stages. Historical
  committed reports were not rewritten.
- `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome make smoke`:
  **80 desktop/mobile Chromium tests passed** using Chrome 155.0.8059.84 in
  12.4 minutes. The first run could not launch the absent Playwright Chromium
  revision 1248, before application assertions. The supported installed-Chrome
  override completed the full suite without changing assertions or retries.
- Markdown formatting, all 201 local links/headings, documented Make target
  references and staged whitespace/credential scans passed. The final
  formatting set includes the two approved internal instruction files.

No live inference, model download, private-data inspection, application deployment
or local container rebuild was performed. Container packaging and image scanning
remain checks for the pushed revision's CI; source checks do not validate the
running private installation or close human/device acceptance.
