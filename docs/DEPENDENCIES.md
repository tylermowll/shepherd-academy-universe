# Dependency baseline

Toolchain refreshed October 8, 2026; application package baseline was verified
September 6, 2026. `pyproject.toml` uses bounded direct requirements so
intent and compatibility remain visible; the exact, cross-platform resolution is
committed in `apps/api/uv.lock` and installed with `--locked`.

Only dependencies used by implemented tasks are installed. The implemented roadmap
adds the provider, image, backup and evaluation dependencies recorded below.

## Persistence baseline (T01 implemented)

The approved SQLite plan is [D004](DECISIONS.md#d004--sqlite-for-the-initial-deployment-2026-09-06).
SQLite has no separate LTS edition; the recorded upstream stable release was **3.53.4**,
verified against the [official release history](https://sqlite.org/changes.html)
on September 6, 2026. The managed Python 3.14.8 interpreter (2026-09-30, checked
2026-10-08) reports **3.53.1** from `sqlite3.sqlite_version`. The tested runtime
retains the D001 compatibility exception and enforced floor of 3.53.1; this
document does not claim that embedded version is the latest upstream release.

T01 added supported stable SQLAlchemy 2 and Alembic releases to the lockfile,
checks the embedded version in `make db`/CI, and covers the relied-upon
surface with on-disk integration tests. The standard sqlite3 driver is used;
a standalone SQLite CLI does not determine its version.

## Frontend and browser tooling

Node.js **24.21.0** is the tested LTS patch verified on October 8, 2026, pinned
in `.node-version`. pnpm
**12.10.1** is pinned in the root `packageManager` field. `pnpm-lock.yaml` records
exact transitive resolutions and integrity hashes; installs use `--frozen-lockfile`.
Project scripts reject unsupported Node and mismatched pnpm versions. Dependency
install scripts are blocked unless explicitly reviewed in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

The versions below were checked against official npm metadata on September 6,
2026 and tested together. TypeScript 6.0.3 and Vitest 4.1.11 are explicit compatible
stable exceptions to newer releases; see [D001](DECISIONS.md#d001--supported-toolchain-baseline-2026-09-06)
for evidence. No `skipLibCheck`, lint suppression, or relaxed peer resolution is used.

## CI tool pins

Hook commands use uv-locked development packages and pnpm-locked frontend tools;
there are no separately resolved hook environments. CI pins uv to 0.12.23 and
Node via `.node-version`; pnpm/action-setup reads the exact root `packageManager`.

| Action             | Release | Verified commit                            |

Pins were checked against the official repositories' release refs on September 6, 2026. Ubuntu 24.04 remains the tested CI runner; runner availability was checked
September 6 (see D001). See TASKS for observed hosted CI runs.

The Python lock resolves 97 packages including development tools. The first audit
identified PYSEC-2026-3552 in cryptography 49.0.0; upgrading to 50.0.1 cleared the
Python audit. The pnpm audit also passed. There is no vulnerability suppression.
Run audits again for release; an earlier pass is not a permanent security claim.

Container bases are digest-pinned in `infra/docker/Dockerfile`; public registry
metadata was verified before pinning. The runtime uses uv-managed Python to retain
the tested embedded SQLite version. CI scans HIGH/CRITICAL findings including
unfixed ones with Trivy action v0.36.0 pinned to
`ed142fd0673e97e23eac54620cfb913e5ce36c25`, and generates a CycloneDX SBOM.
A failed image scan must be fixed or receive a separately documented reviewed
exception; it is never silently ignored. See TASKS for the actual image scan result.

Browser-model files are pinned by exact public repository revision and individual
hashes in `research-manifest.json`. These are metadata, not downloaded weights.
Actual runtime/model/device interoperability remains a maintainer gate (T23).

The first hosted image scan found inherited Debian 12 utilities and unused Python
installer packages (60 OS and two installer findings). D007 replaces the runtime
base with a pinned Distroless Debian 13 image and removes unused installer code.
It retains the exact managed Python/SQLite runtime and locked app dependencies.
The scan threshold and unfixed-vulnerability policy remain unchanged.

## Phone companion QR rendering (T24, 2026-09-07)

`qrcode.react` 4.2.0 renders the expiring upload URL as an SVG locally in the
existing React UI. It ships TypeScript declarations, supports React 19, and adds
no remote QR service, credentials, runtime network calls, or application framework.
The pnpm lockfile pins the package/integrity. See the
[upstream documentation](https://github.com/zpao/qrcode.react).

## T44 toolchain refresh (2026-10-08)

The October 8 metadata review recorded Node 24.21.0 (Krypton LTS), pnpm 12.10.1,
uv/uv_build 0.12.23 and Python 3.14.8. Pins, minimum versions, CI,
README and Docker build/runtime stages match these versions. Public Docker
manifest digests were checked for the exact Node/Python tags before updating.
The managed Python runtime still embeds SQLite 3.53.1, so the documented
compatibility floor/exception remains. The recorded upstream SQLite baseline is
3.53.4; these dated checks do not assert current release availability.

The reviewed TypeScript 7.0.2 release was outside the declared range of
typescript-eslint 8.71.1 (`>=4.8.4 <6.1.0`). Keep the tested 6.0.3
application pin. This update does not claim all application dependency pins are
the newest releases; locked audits and compatibility checks remain required.

Version sources: [Node release metadata](https://nodejs.org/dist/index.json),

Vitest 5.0.3 was rechecked during T44: install succeeded, but `pnpm typecheck`
failed with TS2428 because its `Assertion` type parameters conflict with
`@testing-library/jest-dom` 7.0.1. The temporary upgrade was reverted to 4.1.11;
no `skipLibCheck`, declaration patch or suppressed type error was introduced.
