# Acceptance evidence and final maintainer checklist

Automated checks use synthetic data and on-disk temporary SQLite. They prove
software behavior only. The maintainer explicitly deferred physical phone checks,
live provider/model verification and actual browser-model measurements. Those
remain required before claiming the associated release gates complete.

## Functional/security mapping

T25 is the current product acceptance gate. The A01–A24 table below is historical
math/workflow regression evidence, not proof that the multi-subject tutor works.
In particular, A06/A23's old manual-confirmation behavior and A21's authored-hint
policy do not apply to the primary AI workspace. The maintainer explicitly
rejected templates and photo approvals; see D009.

T25 acceptance must cover:

- Free-text non-math topics without a required level or fixed catalog.
- AI-generated activity → full photo reading displayed before feedback → automatic
  clear-reading continuation → guidance → revision/discussion → appropriate next activity.
- Pasted and photographed assignments used only to generate distinct analogous
  practice; no direct original-homework solving. Reading questions grounded in a
  supplied excerpt, not invented access to a book.
- Uncertain/unreadable photos stop before tutoring and receive concrete
  handwriting/organization advice; there is no approval UI or hidden acceptance call.
- Adjustable initiative and bounded relevant context including previous learner
  work and tutor replies, not just the most recent question.
- Same ownership, revocation, idempotency, retry, deletion, provider-policy,
  no-cloud-fallback, safe-rendering and migration integrity protections as before.

Exact test paths/counts and observed outcomes belong in the T25 TASKS entry.
Synthetic provider responses test software behavior; actual-model handwriting,
pedagogy, groundedness and answer leakage remain separate human-reviewed gates.
Use [TUTOR_EVALUATION](TUTOR_EVALUATION.md) for original cross-subject and homework
policy cases plus an end-to-end iPhone rehearsal.

First-account setup is covered by `test_local_start.py`,
`test_container_start.py`, `test_browser_setup.py` and `test_owner_setup.py`:
native startup, Docker discovery, private socket permissions, link expiry and
renewal, stale-link rejection, atomic account creation and refusal to reset an
existing account. Cookie tests cover scope, signature, expiry, origin binding,
one-use exchange and permission after an API restart. `tests/smoke/setup.spec.ts`
verifies reload/restart recovery, submission after anonymous CSRF expires, and
deferred updates during signup. The user remains signed in after the update.
`scripts/container-smoke.sh` checks the owner command and setup API in a
disposable container. T38 and T39 in [TASKS](TASKS.md) record the commands and results.

Paths below are relative to the repository. `workflows` means
`apps/api/tests/integration/test_workflows.py`; `providers` means
`apps/api/tests/unit/test_provider_contracts.py`; browser scenarios live in
`tests/smoke/bootstrap.spec.ts`. Exact command outcomes are in TASKS.

Additional checks cover migration up/down/schema drift, foreign keys, short
transactions and lock contention, UTC/UUID handling, backup authentication/tamper,
metadata stripping/HEIF, private S3 SDK calls, external questions remaining
unverifiable with zero progress, and offline exact arithmetic. No assertion was
removed to hide a defect. See TASKS for the bugs found and fixed.

## Items requiring the maintainer

1. **Actual phones (T11/T17).** Use a private HTTPS deployment and synthetic work
   on iPhone Safari and Android Chrome. Record device/OS/browser versions, trusted
   certificate, learner sign-in/re-sign-in, denied camera access, JPEG/HEIC
   capture, preview/crop/rotation, clear reading proceeding without approval,
   unclear reading retake advice, 200% zoom, keyboard/screen-reader
   behavior, app installation, update prompt, and background/reconnect after
   submit. Confirm the same operation returns and logout/revocation clears content.
   Expected: no direct homework/active-task answers, no sensitive browser
   cache, no automatic refresh losing unsent work. Attach original synthetic
   screenshots/results; do not upload real learner material.
2. **Live provider evidence (T09/T12/T13/T14/T18/T19).** Choose the providers you
   actually intend to run. Follow PROVIDER_STATUS with exact model/runtime/region,
   eligibility record, explicit data consent and bounded synthetic probes/evals.
   Check Meta's current authenticated wire documentation. Review every initial
   fixture error, especially ambiguity and premature solutions. Record latency,
   tokens and failures separately from correctness/pedagogy. Disabled/unverified
   optional providers must stay labeled that way.
3. **Browser model measurement (T23).** On one named WebGPU device, review the
   separate model license and explicitly consent to the pinned download. Run the
   three synthetic questions, export the report, fill device/memory/battery/
   thermal/eviction/quality fields, exercise cancel/unload/delete, and record cold
   versus warm latency and storage. This is text-only research, never the grading
   engine. No model was downloaded during coding.
4. **Private-host release rehearsal (T19).** Recover settings from your secret
   manager, rehearse encrypted restore into a fresh directory with the current
   deletion ledger, verify worker readiness, sign the administrator and learners
   in again, and confirm backup retention and provider/data policy for the actual
   host. Native synthetic and CI container checks do not validate your private
   deployment configuration.

AWS provisioning is optional and was not performed. If selected, review the
specific AMI, network/certificate/SSM access, retained EBS mount, secret ARN,
least-privilege IAM, and budget before applying the template. No production or
public deployment is implied by pushing the code.
