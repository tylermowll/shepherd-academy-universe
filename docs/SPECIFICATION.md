# Shepherd Academy Universe specification

This document preserves the product, architecture, safety contracts, and roadmap
from the original README. **These are implementation requirements, not working
features.** Start with the [README](../README.md) for tested setup and current
status; use [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) for completion evidence.

Specification baseline: September 6, 2026. External references below retain the
original baseline's verification record; this scaffold review does not revalidate
future provider capabilities, versions, or terms. Recheck them in the task that
implements each integration. No provider or hardware combination has been
live-tested by this project.

## 1. Product and scope

### The project in one workflow

**Choose a topic → receive an AI-generated activity → photograph or type your work → see the reading → receive specific guidance → revise or discuss → get the next appropriate activity.**

The product is a flexible AI tutor across math, writing, reading, history, social
studies, science, and other subjects. It interprets the student's reasoning and
responds to the conversation, rather than restricting teaching to a fixed
catalog or answer grammar. No school level is required. Reliable retries, data
boundaries, replaceable providers, and evidence-backed evaluation support this
learning experience; they are not substitutes for it.

[D009](DECISIONS.md#d009--ai-tutoring-is-the-primary-product-2026-09-07) records the
maintainer's correction of the original catalog-first implementation. T25 is the
current product contract. Historical T00–T24 math/demo/evaluation descriptions
below document earlier engineering work, not restrictions on the AI tutor.
There are **no fixed-template problems and no photo approval gate** in the tutor.

Activity difficulty is a learning preference: `introductory` (Easier), `standard`,
or `challenge` (Harder), defaulting to Standard. Persist it with the session and
apply it to activity and feedback instructions. Easier/Harder next-activity
requests update difficulty and queue the activity in one idempotent transaction.
This is separate from provider reasoning effort. Meta connections may explicitly
select minimal/low/medium/high/xhigh; default omits the parameter. Other adapters
reject non-default effort until their distinct wire contracts are implemented.
Persist selected effort in model-call and probe diagnostics, not reasoning text.
Keep Practice as one chronological session conversation, with current activity
instructions above a bounded scrolling transcript and a stable composer below.
Use one Send action for work and questions. Group attachments, optional help and
explicit next-activity choices in compact controls; put secondary material and
session settings in a desktop side panel or mobile disclosure.
Do not render internal successful activity-generation operations as learner chat.

### First usable release

Deliver a complete, modest application with:

1. An adult administrator, administrator-managed learner accounts, and revocable browser access.
2. Free-text topics, adjustable tutor initiative, AI-generated activities, and persistent practice sessions.
3. Typed work, discussion, and single-photo submissions with automatic reading and quality routing.
4. Specific conceptual guidance, different relevant examples, revisions, and context-aware follow-up activities.
5. A deterministic mock backend, Meta Spark adapter, local Ollama and vLLM adapters, and Amazon Bedrock adapter.
6. Responsive web and installable Progressive Web App (PWA) presentation, containerized self-hosting, tests, and synthetic evaluation fixtures.

The first math-only slice was infrastructure work. It did not deliver the central
AI tutoring experience. Mock workflows do not establish real teaching quality.

### Deliberate exclusions from version 1

No subscription billing, public registration, school information-system integration, classroom roster import, social features, voice, fine-tuning, retrieval database, arbitrary textbook ingestion, general mathematical theorem proving, or unrestricted agent tools. No native mobile application or promise that a large model runs on an ordinary phone. No “mastery” or learning-outcome claims without evidence.

Pasted or photographed homework is supported as **reference material**, never as
a task to complete for the learner. Generate distinct practice covering the same
concepts. A book passage can ground new comprehension questions; a title alone
does not establish access to the text. Reference intake is separate from the
student's attempted response to an app-generated activity.

## 2. Deployment and device strategy

**Choose a web-first PWA. Keep the location of the application separate from the location of model inference.** Installing the web application on a phone does not install its Python server, database, or language model.

| Mode                    | Application and storage                                                  | Model inference                                                   | Phone experience                                 | Release target             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |

| Fully local server      | Desktop, laptop, or home server                                          | Ollama or vLLM on that machine or an explicitly approved LAN host | Browser/PWA connects to the server               | Version 1                  |
| Local app, hosted model | Local server and database                                                | Meta API, Bedrock, or another approved endpoint                   | Same browser/PWA                                 | Version 1                  |
| Hosted web app          | Private server or AWS deployment                                         | Approved cloud or private model endpoint                          | HTTPS browser/PWA                                | After deployment hardening |
| Offline practice        | Previously installed PWA; public problem pack only                       | None                                                              | Deterministic exercises; AI features unavailable | Later enhancement          |
| Entirely on-device AI   | Browser storage and a Web Worker                                         | Small, compatible browser model                                   | Experimental; device-dependent                   | Research phase only        |

A local-server deployment can keep learner content off the public Internet when all selected providers are local and external services are disabled. Initial dependency/model downloads still require connectivity unless separately provisioned. “Local” is not a synonym for “no data leaves the device”: analytics, error reporting, remote images, and accidental provider fallback must also be excluded.

### Phone support requirements

Use a single responsive React interface. Support touch, portrait layout, file selection, camera capture where available, image preview, rotation/cropping, and resubmission. Always offer typed input and file upload if camera access is denied. Do not require installing an app from a store.

Camera APIs and service workers have secure-context requirements. `localhost` on a development computer is different from opening that computer's plain-HTTP LAN address on a phone. The phone runbook must provide trusted HTTPS rather than instruct users to disable browser security. [^S10][^S11]

Future offline results must be labeled client-side/unverified if synchronized; a client-supplied score is not trusted server evidence. Offline mode must not silently create cloud jobs on reconnection.

The PWA service worker must initially cache **only versioned public application assets**. Never cache authenticated API responses, photos, conversations, or provider credentials. Installation is not a claim of offline tutoring. When disconnected, show the actual capabilities available; never simulate an AI answer or silently lose a submission.

### On-device research boundary

WebLLM provides browser inference using WebGPU; Transformers.js provides browser model execution with supported converted models. Neither establishes that an arbitrary Qwen checkpoint, its vision component, and the required context will run acceptably on a particular phone. [^S12][^S13]

The research phase must select one exact runtime/model/device combination, begin with text-only support, and measure download size, memory, latency, battery/thermal behavior, browser eviction, and task accuracy. Use a Web Worker, explicit download consent, model provenance/checksums, cancellation, and an unload control. Browser inference is a **separate frontend transport**, not an API key sent from the browser to a cloud service. Do not port FastAPI or the server database to the phone. Sharing a native shell through Capacitor can be reconsidered later; it does not itself solve on-device inference.

## 3. Learner experience and customization

### Primary screens

| Screen                    | Required behavior                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Adult setup               | Bootstrap administrator, select audience/privacy mode, configure allowed providers, create learner accounts, set/reset passwords, manage signed-in browsers       |
| Tutor profile             | Edit teaching preferences, preview with synthetic examples, create immutable profile versions                                                                     |
| Tutor                     | Choose a topic/reference, receive an AI-generated activity, submit work/photo, see reading and guidance, revise/discuss, request a next activity, retry or finish |
| Session review            | Show attempts, final-answer status, assistance used, unresolved questions, and source/version metadata                                                            |
| Administration/evaluation | Revoke devices, delete/export learner data, view provider health and redacted usage, run synthetic evaluations                                                    |

Keep learner navigation separate from administrator controls. The learner cannot edit endpoints, credentials, retention, age eligibility, or system safety rules.

T26 refines these screens into purpose-specific pages reached by tab-style
navigation: **Practice**, **History**, **Learners**, **Settings**, and
**Help**. Under D013/T37 administrators see Learners, Settings and Help;
learners see Practice, History, and Help.
Keep provider controls and browser experiments out of the practice page. Use
literal labels and contextual help for topic/reference input, tutor style,
photos, sign-in, age categories, and data processing. Help must distinguish
photo QR uploads from learner account sign-in, explain private HTTPS, and
give an actionable path out of demo/unconfigured states. Ordinary page changes
preserve unsent work and pending request identities in memory; browser history
navigation must not bypass ownership or restore another learner's content.

T37 uses four settings sections without a numbered wizard: **Connections**,
**Data & privacy**, **Connection tests**, and **Active models**. Connections
store model access. Data & privacy controls cloud use and age groups. Tests
make explicitly authorized synthetic calls; Active models chooses the tutor and
photo reader for future work. Unchanged connection saves preserve current tests
and approval; real configuration or credential changes require fresh tests and
role approval. A blocked connection explains each requirement and links to it.

D013/T37 uses one administrator and distinct learner accounts. Learner usernames
are unique after Unicode normalization, whitespace normalization and case folding,
and cannot conflict with the administrator username. The administrator creates
accounts, sets/resets write-only passwords, and manages signed-in browsers beside
the selected learner. The common sign-in form accepts either account type. A
learner sees only their own work. Administrator navigation is limited to Learners,
Settings and Help, with synthetic connection tests in Settings. Practice requires
a learner sign-in. Existing IDs and histories are
preserved; duplicate old names receive deterministic suffixes, never a merge.
Existing profiles require an administrator-set password before direct sign-in.

### Tutor profile fields

The primary tutor accepts a free-text topic and an adjustable initiative setting:
`learner_led`, `balanced`, or `tutor_led`. There is no required level or finite
subject catalog. The setting affects how proactively the tutor suggests a next
step and adapts activities; it cannot enable answering the original homework or
change data/provider permissions. Adjustments apply to subsequent requests while
prior responses remain recorded as produced.

The following versioned profile fields describe the historical built-in exercise
module and its regression tests, not restrictions on the primary T25 tutor:

| Field                   | Allowed initial values / behavior                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                  | Adult-selected display label                                                  |
| `topics`                | Explicit identifiers from the supported skill catalog                         |
| `difficulty`            | `introductory`, `standard`, `challenge`; each maps to tested generator ranges |
| `teaching_style`        | `guided`, `direct`, `worked_example`                                          |
| `verbosity`             | `brief`, `standard`, `detailed`                                               |
| `hint_policy`           | Progressive levels; full-solution access controlled separately                |
| `solution_policy`       | `on_request`, `after_two_attempts`, `adult_only`                              |
| `language`              | Default English; do not claim other languages are evaluated until tested      |
| `session_problem_limit` | Default 5; adult-configurable 1–20                                            |
| `question_pacing`       | Default one instructional question per response                               |
| `presentation`          | Font scale, reduced motion, compact explanations; actual UI preferences       |
| `custom_instructions`   | Adult-authored teaching preferences; maximum 2,000 characters                 |

The default preset uses guided explanations but offers a direct explanation when the learner requests one. Do not trap the learner in repeated Socratic questions. Examples should be relevant and age-appropriate without collecting personal interests or diagnoses by default.

Changes create a new profile version. An active session keeps its starting version unless the adult explicitly starts a new session. Custom text cannot enable network access, change provider policy, suppress uncertainty, or grant permissions.

### Example walkthrough

The learner chooses persuasive writing. The AI generates a writing activity. The
learner photographs a handwritten paragraph. The worker recovers the paragraph
and its order, preserving mistakes, and returns legibility/organization advice.
The UI shows that reading before the guidance. Clear readings continue
automatically; uncertain readings ask for a specific improvement or retake.
There is no approval button. The tutor discusses the learner's claim and evidence,
offers a relevant example on a different topic, and asks a useful next question.
The learner revises or discusses it. The next generated activity uses the recent
work and the selected initiative setting. The app does not claim a verified grade.

## 4. Teaching and correctness contract

### Flexible teaching, explicit data boundaries

**Generation:** Generate a fresh activity from the chosen topic or the concepts
in reference material. Use recent work to adapt the next activity. Do not expose
an answer key, solve the reference assignment, or present a copied assignment as
new practice. For reading, ground passage-specific questions in text actually
supplied; ask for an excerpt when necessary.

Practice collects the topic, difficulty, tutor style and optional reference in
one form. It supplies `initial_activity` with session creation so the session,
first activity and pending job are committed atomically. A repeated request key
returns the same session and activity. Photo references create the capture step
directly. Tutor style explanations are visible beside the selector. Composer
menus are mutually exclusive and close on action, Escape and outside clicks.

**Interpretation:** Recover full visible work, including paragraphs, intermediate
steps, labels, and reading order, without correcting its content. Return quality,
confidence, ambiguities, and concrete handwriting/organization advice. The worker
persists the reading before automatically proceeding when quality is `clear`,
confidence is at least 0.85, the transcription is nonempty, and there is no
blocking rejection reason. `clear` means enough task-relevant content is legible
for useful feedback. `ambiguities` records localized uncertainty; incidental
marks, spacing, capitalization, incomplete work or a secondary diagram count do
not alone block feedback on readable content. Incorrect mathematics is not a
readability failure. Counted regions and written labels must be distinguished;
never infer a diagram's count from the expected result. The UI renders the
reading before guidance. No learner approval or browser acknowledgement is
required. The threshold is an uncalibrated routing heuristic, not measured model
accuracy. Essential unreadable content stops automatic photo tutoring and asks
for one specific clarification or cleaner section. Organization advice may be
empty, and must not become a required formatting checklist;
never select a reading because it seems more likely to be the correct answer.

**Tutoring:** Respond to the student's actual work, relevant recent dialogue,
and initiative setting. Answer the latest message's intent directly, including
questions about photo rejection, without forced praise or an unrelated lesson.
Allow an empty next step when the question has been answered. Match explanation
depth to the task objective, selected difficulty and demonstrated understanding;
do not infer mathematical proficiency from handwriting. Identify strengths and likely misconceptions, explain
concepts, ask useful questions, and provide different relevant examples. Be
flexible about teaching style, solution method, and subject. Do not give the active
task's final answer, finish the student's essay, or solve directly supplied
homework. A learner's request or instruction inside an image cannot override that
policy. Raw reference assignments are not replayed into the subsequent guidance
conversation as tasks to solve.

**Evidence:** Reasoning feedback is AI assessment, not independent verification.
Missing exact checking must never block teaching a topic. No model response can
grant permissions, overwrite attempts, change a verified answer key, or certify
mastery. Backend code owns transitions; the learner can revise, discuss, move on,
or finish without a deterministic correct-answer gate.

### Historical exact-math utilities (not the tutoring curriculum)

- Fraction equivalence and simplification; addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using bounded integers and nonzero denominators.
- Linear equations of the form `a*x + b = c`, with nonzero integer `a` and an exact rational solution. Do not quietly accept arbitrary algebra expressions outside the grammar.
- These utilities support exact-arithmetic regression tests and the isolated
  synthetic exercise demo. They do not define which subjects can be taught.

Use Python `fractions.Fraction` and integer arithmetic for version 1. A template has an ID, version, skill ID, seed, parameters, learner-visible problem text, hidden expected result, format constraints, and authored hint/solution material. Store the actual parameters as well as the seed; random generation algorithms may change.

If the selected AI backend is unavailable, preserve the work and show an actionable
retry/configuration error. Do not substitute a template or authored hint and call
it tutoring. A configured mock is explicitly synthetic and cannot read handwriting.

### Historical exact verdicts and current AI guidance

The exact exercise module has the following verdict fields. T25 guidance does
not generate a verified verdict or use these fields to gate the next activity:

Use distinct fields:

```text
answer_status: correct | incorrect | unverifiable | no_answer
format_status: satisfied | needs_simplification | not_applicable | unverifiable
reasoning_status: not_checked | model_feedback_only | deterministically_checked
assistance_level: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
completion: open | completed | skipped
```

Level 0 means no mathematical help; transcription clarification is still level 0. Level 1 is a hint, 2 a direct explanation, 3 a worked example with different numbers, and 4 the original solution. A learner's mathematical question counts as assistance when an instructional response is shown, but is **not an incorrect attempt**. Progress records must not confuse retries, provider failures, or unreadable photographs with mathematical errors.

The server owns verdicts, transitions, help counters, and progress updates. Model output cannot mark a session complete, overwrite prior attempts, or change an answer key. No single successful attempt establishes mastery. Version 1 reports counts and recent outcomes, not a proprietary-looking “ability score.”

### Output contract

Each model call has a typed generation, reading, or guidance schema. Structured
output supports safe persistence and rendering; it must not impose a fixed
curriculum or scripted teaching dialogue. Historical response example:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "message_kind": "hint",
  "message_markdown": "Can you rewrite both fractions using the same denominator?",
  "suggested_next_action": "revise_answer",
  "uncertainty_note": null
}
```

The server derives the legal `message_kind` and checks the result against the requested help level. Allowed next actions are UI suggestions, not executable tools. Do not ask for, display, or persist hidden chain-of-thought or provider reasoning tokens. The learner's own written steps and the tutor's concise explanations are normal application content.

Build each prompt from versioned instructions, current topic/initiative, the
current activity, the student's full accepted reading or typed work, and relevant
recent session turns, including failed/canceled attempts and rejected reader
reports explicitly labeled as uncertain evidence. Reader reports are not direct
image access or verified learner work. Retain up to twelve recent exchanges
across the current session's activities and trim whole exchanges to the provider
budget. Never include another session or learner, or promote raw assignment
references into student-work review. Preserve message roles and bound the total context before
calling the provider. Do not replay unrelated histories or retired photographs.
Provider reasoning settings are adapter-specific and require contract tests.

A schema-valid response can still be wrong or reveal an answer. Schema checks,
source separation, and bounded content checks are useful defenses, not proof of
perfect anti-cheating behavior. Evaluate the actual selected model for false
corrections, answer leakage, grounded reading questions, handwriting uncertainty,
and helpfulness. Do not remove flexible tutoring in order to claim perfect policy
enforcement. Keep open quality gates honest.

## 5. Application architecture

Use a **modular monolith**: one Python codebase, one React application, one SQLite database on local disk, and a separate worker process from the same Python codebase. The initial deployment runs one API process and one worker on one host, serving one household. [D004](DECISIONS.md#d004--sqlite-for-the-initial-deployment-2026-09-06) records the maintainer-approved change from PostgreSQL.

```text
Browser / installed PWA
         |
         | same-origin HTTPS; cookie session
         v
Gateway: static frontend + /api reverse proxy
         |
         v
FastAPI routes -> application services -> domain rules
         |                    |
         v                    v
SQLite (local disk)     private image storage
         |
         | durable jobs; claim/lease/retry
         v
Worker -> provider router -> mock / Meta / Ollama / vLLM / Bedrock
```

### Module boundaries

`domain/` owns immutable problem definitions, exact verification, tutor-profile rules, and state transitions. It must not import FastAPI, database models, cloud SDKs, or provider clients.

`application/` coordinates authorization, persistence, workflows, jobs, and provider requests. `adapters/` contains persistence, storage, and provider implementations. `api/` translates HTTP input/output; no math logic in route handlers. `worker/` executes persisted jobs and performs retention cleanup. The frontend consumes generated API types, not independently maintained copies of backend schemas.

Use ordinary synchronous SQLAlchemy operations through Python's sqlite3 driver and synchronous provider adapters in the initial implementation. FastAPI routes performing synchronous work use `def`; model calls happen in the worker, not an `async def` route that blocks its event loop. An asynchronous rewrite is not a version-1 requirement.

### Why one database

SQLite is the canonical database in development, local deployment, CI integration tests, and the single-host cloud deployment. No database daemon, password, or Docker installation is needed for native development. PostgreSQL becomes a separate future migration decision if measured write contention, multiple application hosts, or availability requirements justify it; do not maintain two engines now.

API and worker share the same private local directory, including WAL/SHM sidecars. Network filesystems and live cloud-sync folders are unsupported. Enable WAL, foreign keys on every connection, a 5000 ms busy timeout, and `synchronous=FULL`; verify those settings in integration tests. Initialize PRAGMAs outside transactions and explicitly configure SQLAlchemy transaction control, including DDL/rollback behavior. Do not rely on sqlite3 legacy implicit transactions. The exact runtime, storage, migration, and recovery contracts are in D004. [^S21][^S41]

### Durable work without extra infrastructure

From T06, persist the submission and its job in **one database transaction** before returning `202 Accepted`. The worker claims a ready row inside a short `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction, conditionally updates its state/lease, commits the claim, and performs inference **outside** the transaction. Handle lock contention with bounded waits/retries. SQLite has one writer at a time; it does not provide `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. T05's immediate deterministic response is specified in D003. [^S21][^S42]

Each job has a lease token, expiration, attempt count, and retry time. Heartbeats extend the lease during long calls. Completion requires a compare-and-set on the current lease token; an expired worker cannot overwrite a newer worker's result. A reaper makes expired leases retryable subject to the retry budget. Persist each pipeline stage so an image confirmation does not trigger repeated interpretation.

Unique constraints and transactions enforce at most one final visible result and one applicable progress update per operation. External inference is still **at least once under failures**: a provider may finish a request after the worker loses connectivity, so duplicate charges cannot be ruled out without provider-supported idempotency. Document this rather than claiming exactly-once API execution.

Do not use in-process FastAPI `BackgroundTasks` as the only record of required tutoring work. [^S20] No Redis, Celery, Kafka, Temporal, or LangGraph is required initially. The database worker is intentionally small and requires concurrency/crash tests. If this design becomes a bottleneck, adopt a maintained queue behind the same job interface rather than spreading queue logic through the app.

## 6. Technology stack and dependency policy

Use the latest LTS line where one exists, otherwise current supported stable
releases, with documented compatibility exceptions and exact lockfiles. The

React, Node, Vite, TypeScript, Python, and Tailwind choices were checked against official project documentation. Node 24 is the latest LTS line. The original Python 3.13 baseline is superseded by D001; current version evidence and compatibility exceptions are in [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md). [^S14][^S15][^S16][^S17][^S19]

Do not put floating `latest` tags in release images or unbounded provider/model identifiers in a reproducible evaluation. Use reviewed, bounded direct dependency constraints and commit exact transitive lockfiles; record image digests at release. `uv sync --locked` must fail when project metadata and the lockfile disagree; `--frozen` skips that freshness check and is not a substitute for it. [^S22]

If a selected library does not work with the baseline, demonstrate the incompatibility, choose the smallest supported adjustment, and record an architecture decision. Do not silently redesign the stack.

## 7. Model backends and routing

### Required adapters

All support is **planned until contract tests and a recorded live smoke test pass**. Keep `docs/PROVIDER_STATUS.md` with provider, endpoint/runtime version, model ID/revision, tested capabilities, fixture results, and date. “API-compatible” is not equivalent to “tested.”

| Adapter ID          | Transport                                       | Initial purpose                     | Important boundary                                                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `mock`              | In-process deterministic fixtures               | No-key demo, CI, failure simulation | Not an AI model; visibly labeled                                         |
| `meta`              | Meta Model API Chat Completions over HTTPS      | Muse Spark 1.3 hosted testing       | Cloud-only; operator-attested audience and provider-specific mapping     |
| `ollama`            | Native Ollama HTTP API                          | Easy local model hosting            | Select an installed vision-capable model for photos                      |
| `vllm`              | OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions              | Local or private GPU server         | Serving version, model architecture, and vision configuration all matter |
| `bedrock`           | boto3 `bedrock-runtime` Converse                | AWS-managed model inference         | Region, model access, IAM, and model-specific capabilities               |
| `openai_compatible` | Explicitly configured Chat Completions endpoint | Additional private/hosted providers | Bounded compatibility; not universal support                             |

Meta's quickstart currently identifies `https://api.meta.ai/v1` and `muse-spark-1.3`. Ollama documents vision and structured-output support; vLLM documents a compatible serving API. Bedrock offers Converse, with structured-output support dependent on model and endpoint. [^S01][^S04][^S05][^S06][^S08][^S09]

### Adapter wire mapping to implement

| Adapter           | Request mapping                                                                                                                                        | Response mapping / trap to test                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Meta              | `POST /v1/chat/completions`; server-side bearer token; model and messages; image content as `image_url` data URI; provider-supported `response_format` | Extract assistant content and usage from the actual documented response. Validate schema and finish/refusal state; do not leak extra provider fields |
| Ollama native     | `POST /api/chat`; `stream: false`; base64 strings in the message's `images`; JSON schema in `format`                                                   | Read `message.content`; preserve documented token counts. A REST image is base64 data, not a local filesystem path                                   |
| vLLM / compatible | Chat Completions under the configured `/v1` base; image data URI when supported; configured model and supported schema mechanism                       | Test the exact installed runtime. Unsupported schema parameters fail capability probing; do not silently downgrade the requirement                   |
| Bedrock           | `boto3.client("bedrock-runtime").converse(...)`; separate `system`, role/content message blocks, bytes in the image source, and `inferenceConfig`      | Parse `output.message.content` by block type, stop reason, usage and metrics. Do not pass a Chat Completions request body directly to Converse       |

The Meta schema/image mapping, Ollama native wire format, and Bedrock schema mechanism have separate official documentation. In Converse, native JSON-schema output uses `outputConfig.textFormat` where the selected model supports it—not the Chat Completions `response_format` field. [^S38][^S39][^S40][^S09] Derive exact nested payloads from the pinned SDK/service version and save synthetic request/response fixtures. Configure SDK retries to avoid multiplying the application's retry budget. Never guess an AWS model ID, inference-profile ARN, or account permission.

### Qwen is a model family, not a protocol

Expose arbitrary operator-configured model IDs; do not bake a particular Qwen release into the domain model. Qwen3.8-27B is one current candidate whose publisher describes native vision-language capability. However, the current vLLM recipe explicitly says its verified coverage is **text serving**. The project must separately test the complete photo path with the selected runtime and weights. [^S07]

Do not promise that a 27B model fits a phone or every desktop GPU. Record quantization, model revision, context configuration, concurrency, image limits, and measured memory use. A smaller model may be preferable for tutoring if it passes the actual evaluation suite. Do not assume code benchmark rank predicts tutoring quality.

### Provider interface

Define typed, provider-neutral objects in `adapters/providers/contracts.py`:

```text
ProviderCapabilities
  text_input, image_input, structured_output_mode,
  max_images, accepted_image_mime_types, configured_context_limit

ModelRequest
  operation_id, stage, model_id, system_instruction,
  ordered_messages, private_image_bytes, response_schema,
  max_output_tokens, timeout_seconds

ModelResult
  validated_payload, provider_request_id, model_id,
  reported_usage, latency_ms, finish_reason

ProviderError
  code, retryable, retry_after_seconds, safe_message,
  provider_request_id

Provider.complete(request: ModelRequest) -> ModelResult
```

Use Pydantic models or frozen dataclasses, not loosely shaped dictionaries passed through the entire application. Keep provider wire formats inside their adapters. Normalize timeouts, authentication failures, throttling, refusal, unsupported modality, malformed output, and context-limit errors.

Version 1 may return a complete response and poll job status; token streaming is not required. If streaming is later added, never stream an unvalidated grading decision or raw JSON fragments into the learner UI.

### Capability and policy routing

Configure two logical routes: `vision` and `tutor`. They may use the same model, or local image interpretation followed by another tutor backend. Route selection must satisfy **both** technical capability and privacy/age policy. Even a transcription can contain personal information; sending only extracted text to the cloud is still a data transfer.

An adapter must explicitly declare a supported capability and pass synthetic probes before the corresponding UI is enabled. Model self-description is not reliable capability discovery. Do not silently drop images or schema requirements to make an API call succeed.

For structured output, prefer the provider's native schema mechanism when available; otherwise use a bounded JSON-only prompt and validate locally. One repair is allowed within the call budget. Do not use regex to extract a convenient object from arbitrary prose and treat it as a successful validated result. Never reinterpret a refusal as malformed JSON and repeatedly pressure the model to answer.

**No automatic local-to-cloud fallback.** If the chosen local model fails, preserve the submission, display an actionable error, and offer retry, typed input, or the built-in explanation. Changing the provider requires an adult-approved policy change and must not retroactively replay existing learner data without explicit authorization.

## 8. Configuration contract

Keep secrets outside Git. Supply `.env.example` and `config/providers.example.yaml`
with no usable credentials. Under D010/T27 the authenticated adult can add, edit,
test, select and remove browser-managed AI connections in Settings. API keys are
write-only inputs stored encrypted in the private database; responses report only
whether a key is configured. File-managed connections remain read-only. The
learner cannot supply an endpoint, credential or policy override.

Saving a connection must not call a model or change active routes. Synthetic
tests and route selection require separate explicit adult authorization. Changes
to endpoints, models, credentials or policy invalidate prior capability evidence
and pending request policy where applicable. API and worker see saved changes
without a process restart. Global cloud/audience controls are available to the
adult in Settings; deployment environment restrictions remain authoritative and
are explained when they lock a control. Demo mode cannot be changed in the UI.

`configured_context_limit` is operator-declared model metadata used for
conservative request budgeting, not a request to allocate that window. Accept
values from 2,048 through 2,147,483,647 so million-token models are representable;
keep actual message, output, image and request sizes independently bounded. The
frontend and both public/private provider schemas must use the same limits.

The persistent local launcher generates only missing settings, loads them without
shell evaluation, validates configuration before building, initializes a fresh
database, and provides a private one-use browser setup link for the first adult
account (D011). Restarting must not
reset the account or replace settings/data. Upgrading retained databases requires
an explicit stopped-write migration. See D010 for credential backup/recovery.

### Environment

The supported variables are documented in [`.env.example`](../.env.example).
`make setup` generates private settings; bootstrap only installs dependencies
(D006). Fixed image and inference budgets are enforced by the backend.

`APP_AUDIENCE` is `adult_only`, `mixed`, or `unknown`; unknown receives the stricter routing policy. The adult assigns a coarse eligibility category where needed—do not collect dates of birth. `APP_MODE=demo` prohibits real uploads, custom free-text learner data, and external model calls; it uses supplied synthetic interactions and photos only.

The URL above uses the container's absolute data path. Native setup generates an absolute path under the repository's ignored `data/` directory; all commands and processes must resolve the same file regardless of working directory. Protect the directory, database, and sidecars with restrictive permissions; SQLite has no database password. Setup generates the session secret, and startup rejects its placeholder. Localhost development may use an explicitly named development cookie configuration. Non-loopback private deployments require HTTPS, authenticated access, and production cookie settings. `.env` is a convenience for local operation, not the production secret-management design.

### Provider configuration example

This is the project's intended YAML schema, not a vendor SDK configuration file:

Use the strict current [provider example](../config/providers.example.yaml).
See D006 for the explicit cutover from the original illustrative schema.

Disabled examples may contain placeholders; enabled routes may not. `host.docker.internal` requires appropriate host-gateway mapping on Linux. Inside a container, `localhost` is that container, not the host. When the model server is another Compose service, use its service name instead. Never expose Ollama/vLLM directly to the public Internet as a shortcut.

Enforce a bounded request budget in the database. Transport retries and schema repairs both count. Honor valid throttling hints with jittered backoff, and do not retry ordinary authentication/validation errors. Estimated cost is shown only when a dated pricing configuration exists; otherwise show reported tokens and mark cost unknown. Do not hardcode today's prices into business logic.

## 9. Data model and invariants

Use UUID identifiers, timezone-aware UTC timestamps, database constraints, and Alembic migrations. Persist UUIDs consistently as text; normalize timestamps through a tested adapter that rejects naive inputs and returns aware UTC values. SQLAlchemy JSON serialized as text is appropriate for schema-validated versioned payloads; it must not replace relational ownership and integrity constraints. Exact arithmetic stays in bounded integer/rational domain code.

Test migrations on temporary on-disk databases with production connection settings. Use Alembic batch operations where a schema change requires a table rebuild; preserve named constraints and existing data, check foreign keys afterward, and run controlled migrations while API/worker writes are stopped.

A single household/private deployment is the first supported isolation unit. Do not claim multi-tenant SaaS isolation. Within that deployment, every learner-facing query and mutation must enforce learner ownership, not merely possession of an unguessable UUID. Adult administrators can review managed learners' sessions; disclose this in the learner interface.

Essential invariants:

- Expected answers and unreleased solution content are never returned in learner problem payloads.
- Submitted work and interpretations are append-only revisions until deletion; confirmation targets one specific version.
- A duplicate request key with the same canonical payload returns the existing operation; the same key with a different payload returns `409 Conflict`.
- One operation creates at most one progress event, even across retries and worker crashes.
- A canceled/deleted learner operation cannot be re-created by a late worker result.
- Tutor instructions and provider configuration are versioned separately; a profile cannot smuggle a new provider URL into a request.
- Use separate public and private Pydantic response types, with tests proving that answer keys and credentials do not serialize into client responses.

## 10. API and job lifecycle

The API exposes `/health` and `/health/live` for liveness and `/health/ready`
for database/worker readiness. Application routes use `/api/v1`. Generate `contracts/openapi.json` from FastAPI and the TypeScript client/types from that file. Treat generated files as read-only and make CI reject drift.

The table describes implemented behavior. T06 supersedes the historical T05
synchronous staging decision (D003); submissions now return `202` and durable
operation state. D006 records the single command for typed work/questions/hints
and the separate raw-image endpoint. Generated OpenAPI defines exact schemas.

Require `Idempotency-Key` for work-creating operations. Use an assignment/interpretation version on mutations; reject stale updates with `409` and return a safe explanation. Initial policy allows only one active grading/help operation per problem; reject conflicting actions rather than trying to interleave help counters.

### Phone camera companion (T24)

An authenticated owner may delegate one photo submission for the current problem
to a phone without account sign-in. A two-hour opaque upload secret grants only bounded
preview/upload and a content-free receipt, never session browsing or confirmation.
Store only its hash and bind it to the issuing device session, problem and
assignment version. The QR carries the secret in a fragment, not a server URL
path/query; requests present it in a header. Generate QR images locally.
Revalidate the issuing session, learner, problem, session state and provider
policy before accepting bytes and again after decoding. A replacement link
invalidates the previous link. Identical retries acknowledge one submission;
reuse with different bytes is rejected. Expired links are swept. In the primary
tutor, clear readings continue automatically without computer-side confirmation.
Reference-photo targets use the same scoped upload to derive distinct practice,
never to answer the original. This deliberately scoped delegation supplements
the ordinary account sign-in and ownership contract; it is not a learner login.

### Submission state machine

Primary T25 workflow: topic/reference → durable generation → assigned activity;
typed work/discussion → durable tutoring → guidance; photo → reading → automatic
tutoring when clear, or rejected-with-advice when uncertain. A clear reference
photo resumes generation of a distinct activity instead of reviewing the original.
The reading persists and is displayed before feedback. There is no approval gate.

The following diagram records the historical exact-exercise path only:

```text
Typed answer: queued -> checking -> tutoring -> completed
Question:     queued -> tutoring -> completed
Photo:        queued -> interpreting -> awaiting_confirmation
Confirmation: awaiting_confirmation -> queued -> checking -> tutoring -> completed

Active stages may become failed or canceled.
A permitted retry returns a failed operation to its saved restart stage.
```

For photo questions, confirmation resumes tutoring rather than final-answer grading. `awaiting_confirmation` releases the worker; it is not a sleeping process or held database lock. Repeated confirmation of the same version must be idempotent. Editing the interpretation creates a new immutable revision.

The operation result separates `answer_status`, `format_status`, `reasoning_status`, `message`, `assistance_level`, and `next_actions`. A worker failure must not become a learner-visible “wrong answer.” Poll conservatively while the page is visible; reconnect by operation ID after navigation or phone backgrounding. Do not rely on mobile background timers for durable execution.

## 11. Images, mathematical input, and output safety

### Image processing

Accept one JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC, or HEIF image per submission. Decode with pinned,
tested `pillow-heif` support where required, then strip metadata and create one
bounded JPEG for preview, private storage, and the provider request [^S37].
Unsupported files receive a clear conversion/retake option. Do not accept PDFs,
SVGs, archives, or arbitrary remote image URLs in version 1.

The application-specific defaults are 8 MiB upload size and 25 million decoded pixels, with a normalized image bounded to 2,048 pixels on its longer side. T24 raises the former 24,000,000-pixel cap slightly to admit 24 MP-class phone images (for example, 5712 × 4284 = 24,470,208 pixels); 48 MP originals remain outside the budget. Provider adapters may apply stricter documented bounds, but must report an incompatible upload rather than silently clipping work. Evaluate readability before reducing these defaults.

Authenticate and authorize before accepting the body where feasible; cap size at both gateway and application. Validate file signatures and actual decoding, not just extensions/MIME headers. Use bounded decoding resources, apply orientation, flatten/re-encode to a safe raster format, strip metadata, generate a random storage key, and store outside the web root. A filename is never a filesystem path. Test corrupt, oversized, misleading, and decompression-bomb inputs. These controls follow the threat categories in OWASP's upload guidance. [^S23]

Show the crop/rotation preview before submission. Avoid detecting or retaining faces, handwriting identity, or location. Do not infer that a photograph contains no personal data merely because obvious names were removed. The provider receives private image bytes through its supported API—not a permanently public object URL.

The picker explicitly accepts JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC and HEIF MIME types and
extensions; dragging a single file into the same control uses identical server
validation. Decode HEIC/HEIF on the server before the browser preview. Normalize
to metadata-free JPEG (quality 90, bounded to 5 MiB with quality 85/80 fallback)
and declare JPEG consistently in provider payloads. Do not expand photographs
into large lossless PNG/base64 requests. Display preparation and model-processing
status with accessible text and a reduced-motion-aware spinner.

### Mathematical input for exact checks only

These parser bounds apply to exact-math utilities, not to general tutoring work.
The AI tutor accepts bounded text and photographs across subjects and methods.

Use a deliberately limited parser: bounded signed integer, fraction, decimal, and `x = value` forms appropriate to the template. Define normalization, maximum length, integer bounds, zero-denominator handling, and decimal-to-rational conversion explicitly. Preserve the original entry for feedback. More advanced grammar requires a new task and tests.

Never pass learner/model text to `eval`, `exec`, Python `compile`, a shell, unrestricted `sympify`, or `parse_expr`. SymPy explicitly warns that `parse_expr` uses `eval`; it is not an untrusted-input sandbox. [^S24] SymPy is not needed for the initial catalog. A later symbolic verifier must build expressions through an allowlisted grammar and bounded constructors.

### Rendered responses

Render restricted Markdown, not raw HTML. Disable raw HTML, external images, and unsafe URL schemes. Keep KaTeX `trust: false`, enforce expansion/size/input limits, and use its accessible HTML+MathML output. The relevant options are documented by KaTeX. [^S25]

Treat instructions in images, learner text, and model responses as untrusted content. The tutor has no filesystem, shell, browser, database tool, MCP integration, or ability to invoke a provider URL named in submitted text. Output text cannot grant permissions. Prompt-injection resilience comes primarily from these boundaries, not a sentence claiming injections are impossible.

## 12. Security, privacy, and minors

### Authentication and authorization

D014 defines first-account creation through a one-use owner setup link. The
unopened link expires after thirty minutes. The browser removes the token from
history and exchanges it in a CSRF-protected request for a signed HttpOnly cookie.
The cookie has SameSite=Strict, Secure on HTTPS, path `/api/v1/auth/setup`, and
an absolute eight-hour expiry. Its signature binds it to setup and the configured
origin. It survives reloads and API restarts with the same deployment secret,
but cannot authenticate ordinary app requests. Discard the owner token after
exchange. Setup checks Origin, CSRF, expiry and rate limits, and atomically
verifies no administrator exists.
Successful setup creates the account and authenticated session; setup never
resets or adds an account after the first claim. Form errors leave services
running and allow correction. Hash passwords with maintained Argon2id.

Native startup prints the setup link. The standard Docker API offers a Unix
socket in an owner-only tmpfs directory (700 directory, 600 socket),
with no network route for issuing owner links. The local `docker exec` command
checks the current database and rotates the process-memory token hash/expiry;
an existing administrator permanently closes issuance. `make start` reconnects
to the recognized running Docker API on port 8000 before loading native settings
or starting another database. Explicit alternate environment files, `make dev`
and `make serve` select native startup.
While first-account setup or its captured authority is active, a waiting PWA
update must defer its refresh action. Once signup establishes the authenticated
session, the normal explicit update action is available. Before submission,
refresh anonymous CSRF so idle forms remain usable. Success or cancellation
clears the setup cookie. Passwords and owner tokens stay out of browser storage.
The Settings page must finish loading when the post-signup session refresh returns
the same identity. Rechecking an unchanged CSRF token and authenticated state must
not invalidate pending requests. Discard responses from a previous identity,
including responses whose body finishes decoding after the identity changes.

HTTP origins with exact loopback hostnames `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` or `::1` allow
six-character passwords; HTTPS requires twelve. Do not impose composition rules.
Passwords below twelve mark the administrator local-only; existing accounts
migrate with that flag false because the previous creation minimum was twelve.
Network startup, login and adult session use reject local-only credentials.
Keep the explicit local administrator-reset command for recovery/strengthening,
not unauthenticated web account recovery. Restarts preserve existing accounts.

D013/T37 replaces passwordless pairing with administrator-managed learner
credentials. Passwords follow the same local/network length policy and Argon2id
hashing as the administrator. Login rechecks the password hash, enabled/deleted
state and network eligibility inside the session-creation transaction, preventing
a concurrent reset from being bypassed. Password reset revokes learner sessions;
no public account list or password recovery is exposed. The CLI cannot create a
second administrator. A learner session cannot become an administrator session by
switching profiles. Retired pairing endpoints issue no new access.

Use `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` or stricter cookies, `Secure` outside loopback development, and an origin-bound CSRF token/header on state-changing requests. Validate `Origin`/host and scope trusted reverse-proxy headers. Restrict CORS to named development origins; production uses same-origin routing. Rate-limit login, uploads, and model operations. Never store cloud credentials or auth tokens in the frontend bundle or localStorage.

### Data boundary and retention

Default to mock/local inference and no telemetry, advertising, session replay, remote fonts, or externally hosted application images. UI labels show where text and photos will be processed before submission. All cloud routes require explicit adult/operator activation; policy must be checked server-side on every operation and before every provider call.

Store normalized photos privately and delete them after confirmed processing completes; failed/unconfirmed photos expire within 24 hours by default. Explain that this limits later visual review. Text/session history defaults to 30 days, configurable by the adult. Purge derived progress when its source learner/history is deleted unless the adult has explicitly selected a documented separate retention rule. Do not retain “anonymous” copies by default.

Deletion revokes access and cancels jobs immediately, then deletes active database/storage content through an idempotent purge operation. Late worker results must be discarded. Logs avoid content and credentials; exports are authenticated and time-limited. Backups have a stated retention window and a restore procedure that reapplies deletion tombstones. Deletion from the application cannot promise immediate removal from provider-side logs or preexisting encrypted backups; document each boundary.

Learner/history purges commit pending opaque image keys in a `photo_deletion`
table before removing their owning records. The worker retries physical deletion
without retaining deleted learning content or losing cleanup references on
restart. A failed file removal must not stop unrelated cleanup or tutoring.
Expired photos cannot be downloaded or sent to a provider even if physical
cleanup is delayed. Worker database/storage failures have bounded retry waits;
single-pass operator commands report failures with a nonzero exit status.

### Provider age and data policies

Meta's hosted API has provider-specific age and data terms. Under D012, the adult
operator selects and attests the audience that their current agreement and
jurisdiction permit; the app displays a disclaimer but does not hard-code a
provider age restriction or certify eligibility. The backend still enforces the
selected audience for every learner request, together with explicit cloud
authorization. A locally hosted Llama model uses its separate model license and
acceptable-use policy and is configured through Ollama or vLLM, not the hosted
`meta` adapter. [^S02][^S46]

Meta documents different Standard and Contributor data-use treatment. Keep Contributor disabled for real learner data. Public source code does not make photos, application logs, environment files, or conversations public data. Non-training promises do not automatically mean zero retention. [^S03]

Bedrock is not a blanket permission for any age or use. Review the chosen model's terms, AWS settings, logging, region, and application obligations. Use workload IAM roles and temporary credentials instead of embedded long-lived keys. [^S26][^S27]

An OpenAI-compatible protocol does not inherit OpenAI's product terms. Each actual provider needs an eligibility record. OpenAI separately publishes under-18 API guidance, including conditions around under-13 personal data; do not treat that as automatic approval for this application's configuration. [^S28]

A public hosted child-facing service requires a separate launch review, including applicable children's privacy obligations. The FTC's COPPA guidance is one relevant US reference; this specification is not a compliance certification. No “COPPA compliant,” “FERPA compliant,” or “safe for every age” badge should be generated from this design alone. [^S29]

### Deployment hardening

Expose only the gateway; keep API/model ports and database files private. Use non-root containers, minimal capabilities, read-only application filesystems where practical, bounded temporary storage, secret mounts, dependency updates, restrictive security headers, and a Content Security Policy compatible with the selected renderer/PWA. Do not expose private FastAPI interactive documentation publicly by default.

Provider endpoints are operator-managed, allowlisted, and immutable to learner requests. Permit named loopback/private endpoints only when deliberately configured for local inference. Block redirect-based endpoint escape, link-local metadata targets, user-info URLs, and arbitrary user-supplied destinations. Do not implement a public URL-fetching feature.

The tutor should remain an educational tool, not claim to be a human friend or professional, request secrets, or encourage dependency. If a learner raises a serious safety concern, provide a brief appropriate safety response instead of rigidly insisting on math. Do not send automated messages to parents or emergency services. Evaluate these behaviors without claiming that a filter eliminates all risk.

## 13. Testing and model evaluation

### Four different test layers

**Domain tests:** exact arithmetic, template constraints, simplification rules, bounded parsing, state transitions, assistance accounting, and no answer-key leakage. Use property tests over generated cases, including negative values, equivalent fractions, large bounded inputs, and division by zero.

**Integration tests:** real SQLite migrations and constraints on temporary on-disk databases, authorization across two learners, job leases, worker crashes, deletion races, configuration policy, and provider wire formats. Verify connection settings, lock contention, rollback, and persistence after reopening. Use independent connections/processes for competing claims and stale leases even though deployment configures one worker. Fake provider HTTP responses are acceptable for transport tests, but mocked SQL or in-memory-only databases do not satisfy transaction/concurrency gates.

**UI/end-to-end tests:** keyboard/touch flows, photo confirmation, questions versus answers, retry/reconnect, adult pairing, and deletion. Use Playwright in CI, and record separate manual checks on actual phone Safari/Chrome. Desktop browser emulation is not proof of real-device camera/HEIC behavior. [^S30]

**Model evaluations:** original or licensed synthetic exercises and handwritten fixtures with known interpretations, answers, permissible help levels, and failure expectations. Evaluate an exact provider/model/runtime/prompt/profile combination. Mock responses test software orchestration, not model quality.

### Model evaluation reporting

Track transcription exactness and ambiguity handling separately from final-answer accuracy and pedagogical quality. Report denominator/sample size, fixture categories, failures, model/prompt versions, and date. Include false correction, premature solution disclosure, correct-answer rejection, schema failure, refusal handling, latency percentiles, token usage, and configured cost estimate when available.

Start with at least 30 original fixtures across clear, messy, rotated, ambiguous, and adversarial work; expand before making broad accuracy claims. Hold back a small set not used to tune prompts. A model-based judge may assist triage but cannot be the only authority; exact checks and adult review of rubric-scored examples remain necessary. Report measured results, not aspirational numbers or an invented “99% accurate” badge.

Functional/security acceptance scenarios must all pass. For model rollout, the adult maintainer reviews every error in the initial evaluation set and records whether the intended use is acceptable. A small passing fixture set is not proof of general tutoring reliability or improved learning.

### Current implementation

See the [README](../README.md) for working features and commands,
and [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) for evidence and remaining gates. The tree below is the original architectural outline;
implemented paths and verification limits are recorded in TASKS and OpenAPI.

Directories are created when their phase needs them; do not fill the tree with empty production stubs merely to match a diagram. The target tree does not imply that these files exist yet.

### AGENTS.md and .agents are different

`AGENTS.md` is the repository instruction convention; nested files refine instructions for their directories. The Agent Skills standard defines a skill directory with a `SKILL.md` containing YAML metadata and instructions. [^S31][^S32]

Use `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` as the canonical repository location. OpenAI's current Codex documentation explicitly describes discovery there. That does **not** mean every coding client—including every Muse Code version—automatically discovers the same directory. [^S33]

For Spark/Muse Code, the portable fallback is explicit: tell it to read `AGENTS.md` and the relevant skill file before each task. Verify its installed client's current instruction/skill discovery using that client's documentation/help. If it requires another location, add a thin documented link/wrapper to the canonical file and test discovery; do not maintain competing copies of the instructions. A folder called `.agents` does not create runtime agents, grant permissions, or automatically execute scripts.

Keep the root instructions short. Detailed requirements belong in this specification or in task-specific documents, and skills should point to the relevant sections. Do not preload every skill and every document into every prompt. Agent Skills guidance recommends compact skill bodies with detailed reference material loaded when needed. [^S34]

### Agent working method

Before changing code, the agent checks repository status, reads the task and governing instructions, identifies affected contracts, and writes a small implementation/test plan. It then implements the smallest vertical slice, runs targeted tests, runs broader checks when applicable, and records exact evidence in `docs/TASKS.md`.

Do not let the agent declare a task complete because it created files or because the interface “looks right.” Do not let it remove assertions, relax policy, skip failing tests, or rewrite the specification to hide an implementation failure. A command not run must be labeled “not run,” with the reason. Real-provider tests requiring credentials are reported separately from mock/contract tests.

Use one implementation agent at a time initially. An independent review pass can inspect changes, but reviewers should not race to edit the same files. No background promise, autonomous deployment, paid cloud provisioning, secret rotation, or publication to GitHub without explicit maintainer authorization.

## 15. Implementation roadmap

**Build in dependency order. Each task produces a working increment and a testable result.** If the agent cannot complete a task, keep it in progress and record the concrete blocker. Do not drift into later phases as a substitute.

T24–T40 are maintainer-directed increments whose governing product changes are
recorded in Decisions D009–D014 and whose bounded contracts and evidence are in
`TASKS.md`. They do not revive requirements superseded by those decisions.

### T41 maintenance contract

T41 depends on the current T25 tutor, D013/T37 account model, and T38–T40 startup
and setup behavior. Its deliverable is a role-by-role reliability review and a
bounded repair of broken transitions: acknowledged tutor/provider saves remain
recoverable without duplicate work, page focus and account handoffs are explicit,
the conversation and its controls remain usable at supported desktop/mobile
widths, native and Docker instructions form executable sequences, Docker API and
worker service definitions carry the same host-model routing configuration, and
locked dependencies have no known vulnerability at review time.

Exit evidence requires focused component regressions, the complete backend,
frontend, integration and desktop/mobile browser gates, locked dependency audits,
and a hosted `docker compose config` check before the container build/smoke/scan
job. Real phone/accessibility checks, live provider quality, and the private-host
release rehearsal remain explicit external acceptance work; their absence must
not be reported as automated completion.

The maintainer initially deferred hosted CI execution during local development,
then authorized the first commit and push. T00's
configured CI workflow plus passing local gates suffice for starting T01; retain
hosted CI as pending evidence under [D002](DECISIONS.md#d002--local-t00-completion-2026-09-06).
See [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) for bounded T01–T05 deliverables and the T05 staging
decision. No later acceptance gate is waived.

T00–T05 are the first complete **non-AI** slice. T06–T10 add the controlled tutoring workflow. T11–T19 finish portable version-1 behavior. T20–T23 are later work, not excuses to delay a usable release.

Tasks may need splitting into smaller subtasks before implementation. Keep their parent acceptance criteria and dependencies. Never mark T19 complete while core providers are only undocumented stubs; a missing live credential may be an explicit verification limitation, but implemented adapters still need meaningful contract tests.

## 16. Development and release commands

The [README command table](../README.md#development-commands) describes implemented
entry points; the [Makefile](../Makefile) is authoritative. The full contract below
is added by the phase that first needs it. A table entry alone does not mean a
command exists. Do not add a placeholder target that reports success.

### Required command contract

After a working release exists, the intended self-hosted path is:

```bash
# From a checked-out repository, after the implementation gates pass:
cp .env.example .env
cp config/providers.example.yaml config/providers.yaml
make bootstrap
make db
make migrate
make admin
make dev
```

In T00, `make check` runs the real checks for the implemented scaffold; each later task adds its required gates. A target for an unimplemented feature must fail with a clear message rather than pretend success.

Bootstrap must explain any unmet prerequisite instead of continuing with placeholders. It must not install an arbitrary model, accept model licenses, open firewall ports, contact a live provider, or overwrite credentials without explicit authorization.

### CI requirements

Run locked installs (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `uv sync --locked`), Ruff, mypy, frontend type checks/lint/tests/build, backend tests, on-disk SQLite integration tests, Playwright, generated-contract checks, secret scanning, and dependency vulnerability checks. T01 adds the embedded SQLite version check and integration gate without a database service container. Make scan failures actionable and any temporary exception documented with an owner and expiration.

GitHub Actions should have minimal permissions, pinned verified full commit SHAs for third-party actions, bounded artifact retention, and no provider secrets in fork pull-request jobs. Do not execute untrusted pull-request code with a privileged `pull_request_target` workflow. GitHub's security guidance explains the immutable action-pinning requirement. [^S35]

Release builds additionally generate a software bill of materials, scan container images, record image digests, and publish only after authorization. CI uses synthetic fixtures and mock providers; live evaluations are separate opt-in jobs and never the default for arbitrary pull requests. No fake badges, placeholder success scripts, or CI commands that swallow errors with `|| true`.

## 17. Hosting runbooks

### Local computer or home server

Native development runs the application directly; optional Compose packaging runs the gateway, API, and worker on one host. API and worker mount the same private local data directory for SQLite and its sidecars, with persistent storage outside container layers. There is no database service. Ollama/vLLM is optional and can live on the host or another private machine. Bind to loopback by default. For phone access, deliberately enable LAN listening, configure trusted HTTPS and authentication, and document firewall access without public router port forwarding.

The server must remain awake and reachable while the phone uses it. Offline Internet can still permit local-network tutoring, but losing the LAN connection or stopping the server removes that capability. A plain public GitHub Pages deployment cannot host this Python backend and writable database; at most it can serve a static synthetic demo or a later browser-only mode.

### Hosted web application

Reuse the same image and single-host application layout. Terminate TLS at the gateway, keep API/model endpoints and database files private, use persistent local storage, and execute migrations as a separate controlled deployment step with writes stopped. Do not place SQLite on a shared network filesystem or scale application replicas across hosts. Provide backup and restore tests before real learner use. Do not use ephemeral container filesystems as permanent database or image storage.

### AWS: inference and hosting are independent

**Bedrock inference can be used while the app stays local.** This requires only the Bedrock adapter, appropriate region/model access, and credentials obtained through the AWS SDK's supported mechanisms. [^S08][^S26]

For later AWS application hosting, use one EC2 host with persistent encrypted EBS storage and the same gateway/API/worker layout. SQLite remains on a local filesystem on the attached volume. Serve frontend assets and terminate HTTPS at the gateway to preserve same-origin behavior. Use private S3 for retained objects/backups when introduced, Secrets Manager for secrets, and instance-role access to permitted services. Define volume retention and explicit remount/restore steps before replacing the host. This reference design provides neither horizontal scaling nor automatic failover. [^S45]

Use CloudFormation for the initial infrastructure template to avoid adding another provisioning language/toolchain. Validate templates without applying them. The deployment guide must discuss recurring costs—including the instance, EBS, public addressing/egress, object storage, secrets, logs, backups, and model requests where used—without inventing current prices. Do not provision this stack automatically.

A self-managed GPU endpoint is a separate optional compute decision; the application host does not imply GPU capacity. Use instance IAM roles, private buckets, scoped permissions, encrypted storage, limited logs, budget alarms, and explicit model/inference-profile regions. Cross-region routing requires a documented data-boundary decision. Keep prompts/images out of model-invocation logging unless explicitly approved for a narrowly scoped diagnostic.

Storage adapters must support local private files first and S3 in the AWS phase. The rest of the application refers to opaque storage keys, not provider-specific URLs. Create consistent database backups through SQLite's backup API or a documented quiesced procedure; copying only a live WAL database's main file is invalid. Restore tests cover database integrity, foreign keys, retained objects, configuration, and deletion tombstones. [^S44]

## 18. Definition of done and public presentation

A version-1 release is ready only when a clean clone can run the mock demo without paid accounts, the principal workflow and exception paths pass, privacy boundaries are enforced, and each claimed provider has an honest status record. An adapter may be labeled “implemented; contract-tested; live test pending,” but not “fully verified.”

The public README should eventually include actual screenshots or a short recording using original synthetic data, a concise architecture explanation, tested setup commands, measured provider results, limitations, and the license. Remove the blueprint warning only for functionality that exists; keep roadmap items marked as planned.

Contributor-facing documentation should explain the design decisions: separate interpretation/checking/tutoring, exact math, versioned attempts, no silent cloud fallback, and durable operations. Disclose AI-assisted implementation while describing the human specification and evaluation work honestly. Code volume is not the project's main evidence of quality.

Target WCAG 2.2 AA, but do not claim conformance before an audit. Test visible labels, keyboard operation, focus management, zoom, non-color-only status, accessible mathematics, and reduced motion. Automated accessibility checks help but do not replace manual review. [^S36]

Do not commit real learner data, employer code, private documents, model weights, credentials, or copied workbook pages. Every public fixture has provenance in `evals/MANIFEST.md`. Add the actual selected project license before releasing code, and document separate licenses for dependencies and model downloads.

## 19. Maintainer decisions and non-goals

The following defaults allow implementation to start without another planning round:

| Decision             | Chosen default                                                     | Change procedure                                                                       |

| Initial use          | One private deployment, adult administrator, managed learners      | Multi-tenant/public sign-up is a separate architecture review                          |
| Primary client       | Responsive PWA                                                     | Native shell only after a concrete unmet requirement                                   |
| Core topics          | Fractions and `a*x+b=c`                                            | Add a template/verifier/evaluation task                                                |
| Local model strategy | Ollama for simplicity; vLLM for server deployment                  | Verify exact model/runtime instead of hardcoding assumptions                           |
| Initial model route  | Mock; explicitly activate permitted live routes                    | Privacy/capability checks are mandatory                                                |
| Database             | SQLite on local disk, one host (D004)                              | PostgreSQL requires a separate scaling/availability decision and tested data migration |
| Application workflow | Deterministic services and durable jobs                            | No multi-agent orchestrator without a demonstrated requirement                         |
| Hosting              | Native local setup; optional single-host Compose and EC2/EBS phase | No shared/network-mounted SQLite; infrastructure provisioning requires authorization   |
| Data retention       | Photos up to 24 hours; history 30 days                             | Adult-controlled, documented, tested changes                                           |
| Offline behavior     | Honest unavailable state; later public practice packs              | Full offline AI stays research until measured                                          |
| License              | MIT, approved and added (D006)                                     | Model weights and third-party dependencies retain their own licenses                   |

A fully customizable tutor does not require letting users modify every safety-critical parameter. Version 1 customization is deliberately about pedagogy, topics, and presentation, while operators own infrastructure and data policy.

## Appendix A. Root AGENTS.md

The root instructions now live in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). That file is authoritative;
its content is not duplicated here because parallel normative copies drift.

## Appendix B. Portable skill example

The portable implementation skill now lives at
[`.agents/skills/implement-task/SKILL.md`](../.agents/skills/implement-task/SKILL.md).
Keep task-specific skills small and add another only when a repeated workflow needs
non-obvious guidance.

## Appendix C. First implementation prompt

The one-time bootstrap prompt is retired. Continue from the current task in
[`docs/TASKS.md`](TASKS.md), following `AGENTS.md` and the applicable task skill.
[HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) contains the T01–T05 prompt and local verification gates;
hosted CI evidence remains pending under D002 until an actual run is observed.
