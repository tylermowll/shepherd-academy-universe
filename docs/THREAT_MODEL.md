# Threat model and operating limits

The supported isolation unit is one private household deployment. The host owner
and adult administrator are trusted with managed learner data. Internet clients,
learner text, model output, and uploaded files are untrusted. This is not a
multi-tenant service or a claim of regulatory certification.

| Boundary              | Enforcement and evidence                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Browser identity      | Argon2id adult login, hashed opaque cookies, expiry/revocation, CSRF and exact configured Origin/Host; no tokens in localStorage                                                                           |
| First-account owner   | Native launcher or private Docker owner socket issues a one-use link; exchange grants a scoped HttpOnly cookie; CSRF/origin/rate checks and atomic first claim; no public owner-link issuance or web reset |
| Local password policy | Six-character minimum on HTTP loopback only; short passwords flagged and rejected for network startup, login and adult sessions; HTTPS creation retains twelve-character minimum                           |
| Learner sign-in       | Unique usernames, Argon2id passwords, rate limits and revocable sessions; the administrator creates accounts and resets passwords                                                                          |
| Learner ownership     | Backend principal and joins on every practice/photo/operation route; two-learner isolation tests                                                                                                           |
| Private answers       | Separate public DTOs omit hidden answers, seeds and private parameters; AI generation returns an activity, not a solution key                                                                              |
| Untrusted math        | Bounded ASCII parser and Fraction arithmetic; no eval, SymPy parser, code execution or tools                                                                                                               |
| Model authority       | Typed output permits flexible conceptual/reasoning guidance but not permission changes or verified grades; server owns durable transitions                                                                 |
| Teaching evidence     | Backend attaches assistance and owned activity/submission provenance; adaptive memory admits current source-scoped evidence, excludes future sections and old prompt observations; no mastery claim        |
| Homework references   | Separate reference intake from student responses; generate distinct analogous practice, exclude original assignments from later tutoring context; actual answer-leak resistance needs model evaluation     |
| Photo interpretation  | Persist and display reading before feedback; automatically continue clear readings, stop unclear work with concrete advice; no approval gate; confidence is an uncalibrated model claim                    |
| Provider egress       | Operator-owned routes, explicit cloud enablement, audience/capability checks and recent synthetic probes; no redirect or automatic alternate route                                                         |
| Image upload          | Auth before decoding, bounded body/pixels, accepted raster formats only, decode/normalize, metadata removal, opaque private object keys                                                                    |
| Browser rendering     | Escaped text, restricted markdown and KaTeX with trust disabled, CSP, no remote content rendering; public-only service-worker cache                                                                        |
| Source fidelity       | Reading material and quotations render literally; Unicode codepoint limits and encoded-body budgets agree; saved source offsets exclude future sections from guided model context                          |
| Worker recovery       | Short immediate claims, lease-token completion checks, six-call budget, persisted generation/reading/tutoring stages and idempotent results                                                                |
| Interrupted requests  | Browser session storage holds only opaque request/learner IDs and kind; owned receipt lookup/resolution serializes with acceptance; no draft/photo replay or stored auth token                             |
| Deletion              | Immediate revocation/cancel, late-result discard, content-free tombstone journal replayed on restore                                                                                                       |
| Repository            | Private-path/key/token checks, locked dependency audits, no credentials or live learner fixtures                                                                                                           |

Host files use private permissions and should reside on an encrypted local volume.
The shorter local password is an explicit convenience tradeoff, not strong
password guidance. Keep setup links private. An unexpired link can be exchanged
once for an HttpOnly setup cookie with an absolute eight-hour lifetime. The
signature binds the cookie to setup and the configured origin. It survives API
restart with the same secret and cannot authenticate normal app requests.
Renewing a link replaces the unopened token, not permission already exchanged by
a browser. Account creation closes all setup access. Docker link issuance
requires the owner-only Unix socket through `docker exec`; no HTTP route issues
links. App updates wait until signup finishes before offering a refresh. Setup
never authorizes recovery of an existing account.
SQLite does not encrypt itself. Backups use authenticated encryption with a
separate passphrase; losing the passphrase loses recovery. Preserve the current
deletion ledger separately from old archives. Operator settings/secrets require
their own secure recovery process.

Image access and new vision calls enforce the photo retention deadline even if
storage cleanup is unavailable. Learner/history deletion records pending image
keys in the same transaction as its database purge. The worker retries physical
deletion after storage recovers; pending keys contain no learner text or identity.
Transient filesystem/database errors produce content-free warnings and bounded
worker retries, without resetting job leases or provider-call budgets.

The primary tutor provides model-based reasoning guidance across subjects. It is
not an independently verified grade, a proof of mastery, or a guarantee of factual
correctness. A clear/high-confidence reading can still be wrong; the student can
point out the error or resubmit. Ambiguous work is not guessed into a solution.
The no-homework-answers policy uses source separation, instructions and bounded
output checks. These do not prove that arbitrary model text can never disclose an
answer. Human review of actual-model failures is required; mock success is not
evidence of robust anti-cheating or handwriting accuracy.
Live providers need a reviewed eligibility/privacy record for the intended
audience. An operator can mislabel a remote endpoint as local; review endpoint
DNS/network ownership and apply host egress controls where required.

Rate limits are process-local and reset on restart, which matches one API process.
JSON body caps are 16 KiB by default, 256 KiB for submitted work and 1 MiB for
tutor session/activity intake; these envelopes admit the schemas' bounded
Unicode text even when JSON-escaped. Images are capped at 8 MiB and 25 million
pixels, then normalized to 2048 pixels. Provider responses are bounded, timeouts
are at most 90 seconds, and operation calls at most six. Resource limits
reduce abuse; they are not a substitute for authenticated private deployment.

Pending external review: physical device camera/certificate/update behavior,
manual keyboard/screen-reader audit, provider eligibility and quality, AWS account
policy/cost review, and browser model resource measurements. No WCAG conformance,
penetration-test, multi-host availability, or production-readiness claim is made.
